Chicago,"This home was definitely one of my Top Air bnb homes that I have visited. Downtown wasn’t to far so our Uber rides weren’t too expensive. The complementary garage was definitely a plus! Only thing we had to get used to was the water in the shower not being as warm as we were used to, but we are also from Florida so the temperature doesn’t effect our water at home lol.

Although we did not see the host, communication was excellent and they provided a wonderful list of places for sight seeing, eating, and night life. We will definitely be back for another visit.

Chicago,"We loved it! The apartment was in a safe area (our number one priority). It was BEAUTIFUL and the bed was the MOST comfortable we have ever slept on. It was centrally located next to cvs, a food store, etc... walking distance. Dasha responded quickly anytime for anything we asked. We loved they had coffee in the unit and creamer in the fridge. I know this probably was Not their norm but it was a nice touch to leave it there. There isn’t a dishwasher and the microwave is on the bottom drawer but this didn’t bother us. We were so pleased with everything else, we would forfeit those for what we did have. Keyless entry into the building and into the apartment. It was extremely clean and we had shampoo and soap (also important to us). The towels were plenty for us and thankful for an extra one just in case we needed it. Oh, and we LOVED having Netflix available. This was Brian and mine once a year get away from the responsibilities of life (kids, dogs, careers) and we loved the ability to “Netflix and chill” w each other. We want to come back soon for a quick weekend getaway and maybe bring the kids next time. Although we would have to have a different unit for the kids, we would definitely try to stay at one of Dasha’s properties (she has a few to choose from). Thank you Dasha for everything. :)",1.0
Chicago,"I truly enjoyed my stay at the loft and will be booking again real soon. Upon check-in I was met with clean towels, a full kitchen with amenities, and a basket of clean towels and linens. The space heated fairly quickly which was great for my October stay in Chicago! The neighbors were all very quiet. I cannot tell you how comfortable the bed was - it was out of this world! I haven’t slept that good in years. Overall, everything was spotless (and the cleaner personally message me to ensure I was comfortable).

Overall good stay,1.0
Chicago,"Small, cozy apartment that is gorgeous to stay. The bed was so soft and amazing, it was difficult getting out of bed. The blue line will get you to downtown in about 20 minutes, not including your 12-15 minute brisk walk to the blue line. The downstairs Mexican restaurant, La Oaxaqueña, was homemade cuisine with great hosts. There are stores, shops, restaurants, etc...all close by.

Chicago,We love this place because it is absolutely gorgeous and stylish. My wife and I just got married and spent a few days in Chicago and we were glad to stay here for our mini-moon. Communication was also great from the start and it was clean. My only hesitation would be that it's pretty far from downtown around 30 minutes away and the bus in front took long but Uber was very easy and not as expensive as we thought it would be. We're planning to go to Chicago again and we will definitely hit up this place again when we do!,1.0
Chicago,"The space is awesome, Netflix on a huge TV is provided. The bed was insanely comfortable. The space was also really clean and felt super safe.

Chicago,"I was in town for the Justin Timberlake concert at the United Center and stayed at Dasha & Owens place. It was an extremely easy check in, and it’s awesome having a private garage.

Chicago,"I really enjoyed my stay at Dasha & Owen's place.  I stayed two nights, while on business.  It was great to be able to prepare a meal and stay in and work one evening, rather than eat out.  There is a full set of spices, olive oil, and balsamic-- everything you need to enjoy a light meal.  A hair dryer, iron, shampoo/ conditioner/ body wash-- all were provided and were great for business travel.  I had an excellent night of sleep, as the bed in this unit is exceptionally comfortable.

Chicago,I could go on and on about how much we loved staying here! Came up for a girls weekend and it was just what we needed. We were allowed to check in early when our flight got in. The loft is super eclectic but it is a working space!! If you are any sort of froo froo this is not the space for you but we loved the charm. The deck is gorgeous and it was the BEST location. We took one Uber the whole time we were there. Michael made sure we had everything we needed while we were there and we loved chatting with him!

Chicago,"What a great space! Prime location in the heart of River North, top floor loft (no elevator, as stated) with DIRECT access to the connected vast rooftop garden and sitting area (beautiful city views), and just an all around fun space. Exactly as expected via the pictures Mike has posted for the listing, and we were completely satisfied. (Might I add the King bed is very comfortable!)   There is indeed an in-room mini-bathroom just for our use, but the larger bathroom in the Commons was so cool -- Brazilian shower and all!  Thanks again for being so welcoming. We'll be back.",1.0
Chicago,"Michael is fantastic. He was welcoming, warm, and generous when we stayed with him this past Friday. We loved our cozy room, the art and decor was so unique, the location was perfect, and the rooftop patio was a great bonus. It’s probably even better in the warmer months, as we saw Michael’s seed collection laid out for spring planting, but we still enjoyed it! Michael even gave us his wool blanket for the baseball game we attended— very thoughtful and kind. We would love to stay here again someday!",1.0

Chicago,"I loved this place, I didn’t even want to leave the house. Not only are the views great, but Michael has a great selection of books, records and art.

I would go and book another stay if he wasn’t booked out all summer! I’ve made a great friend and so will you.",1.0
Chicago,"What can I say? Michael's place was just what I needed! I loved the sheets and the big bed was super cozy and comfy! Having privacy in the bedroom was great and having the bathroom in the there was such a nice touch. I loved the location!  It was close to everything and I was seeing Hamilton the night I stayed there. It was a nice evening, so I decided to walk there and it only took about 15-20 minutes. The morning I was checking out, I had the chance to sit and chat with Michael on my way out while he prepared for his next guest. What a great, down to earth, knowledgable, compassionate adventure seeker Michael is...I loved the stories he had about the artistic and eccentric atmosphere that his  loft had to offer!

The place is nestled in a lovely block on River North practically unnoticed to the eye if you are not paying attention. For those that want a real cultural Chicago experience, this place is it. I am already booking my next trip and staying here. Book this place, you will probably want to move to Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"Do yourself a favor and book this room. This space is eclectic, and artistic. Michael is warm and welcoming and always communicated quickly. He has great stories and immediately will make you feel at ease (I was a female traveling with my 11 year old daughter, and not once did I feel anxious). Michael is full of tips and tricks to navigate the city, and  knows all the good places to get grub. He even provides the nicest toiletries and products for the ladies! The rooftop deck sets everything off, and it is amazing to be up there watching the city go by. Cool place, cool guy, this place made our trip awesome! Oh, and do yourself a favor and go see Hamilton while you're in town. You won't regret it!",1.0

Chicago,"We had a fabulous time at Michael’s place. The location can’t be beat. The deck is amazing and so are the windows in his place. Michael is a wonderful host with lots of humor,  great stories to share and an incredible artist. We had the private room tucked away in the back, which was great. Next time we’re going to try for the loft which isn’t as private, but it’s a really cool space in front of those amazing windows.",1.0

Chicago,"Due to weather I was unable to stay at Michaels loft.. however I would like to say that even though I did not get to meet Michael personally.. he went above and beyond to refund me due to weather and was very understanding and overly caring with his quick responses.

Overall an excellent stay with a very friendly host.",1.0
Chicago,"Stayed two nights that were booked separately so won't repeat what I've previously written. I will had that the apartment has a huge, fabulous shower. Michael says its Brazilian style, and it includes tiled floor and wide rain shower head.",1.0
Chicago,"Michael thinks of everything, anticipating his guests' every need. He even had extra tooth brushes, so a forgetful old man (me) would have one. His spacious loft is furnished with lovely vintage items, including many of his own works, all arranged in a pleasing, artful fashion. In addition to being a great host, Michael is a wonderful human being and delightful raconteur. We had coffee with him both mornings of our stay, and by the second day he was already like family. Hope we can stay with him again. If you're going to be in or around the loop, the location is perfect, and the price is a bargain. He also directed up to a website that gave us a parking garage just three minutes' walk away that was only $20 for 24 hours. Unbelievable!",1.0
Chicago,Warm and comfortable retreat in the center of Downtown located right next to great food and entertainment. Michael was a fantastic host making check-in and check-out easy and quick and even had fresh orange juice for the morning. A great stay.,1.0
Chicago,"Michael’s place was a charming and quirky artist’s loft. It was in an ideal, trendy neighborhood. Our host was very accommodating and very knowledgeable (he’s lived there over 30 years). Although the apartment was shared, each bedroom had its own restroom and there was plenty of common space to enjoy. We were there during the winter so it was difficult to enjoy the rooftop garden but I’m sure it is wonderful in warmer weather. Overall, this was a great experience for our family.",1.0

We had no issues getting anywhere and Michael was VERY hospitable. We had more fun chatting with him and the other guest at the loft than we did touring the city. His place is very comfortable and homey. Even in the cold weather, his deck was gorgeous and the plants in his home were beautiful. The whole experience was incredible!!",1.0
Chicago,"This place is great. I will definitely be back. It’s a bohemian working art gallery with a super location. If you like art, it’s sort of like staying in a cool museum. The patio was amazing. So much so that we sat out there even though it was 35 degrees. I highly recommend this place.",1.0

We had the pleasure of staying in both of the bedrooms listed in the same building and both were lovely, the loft is SO cute and the private bedroom is very nice with your own bathroom inside, both with huge comfortable beds. The amenities provided were out of control, anything you could possibly need is probably there for you (did you forget a toothbrush? razor? floss? not to worry! it's there!)! Definitely the best airbnb experience I have had to date and I hope we can stay there again! Thanks Michael!!",1.0
Chicago,Michael is a very genuine soul and really knows how to treat a person. definitely adds on top of how cool his apartment is. this was my first Airbnb place I've ever stayed at and a great experience at that. definitely will start using it more often and I would definitely stay here again when coming back to the Windy City.,1.0

His apartment is a exquisite wonderland in Chicago downtowns, the inside of apartment has really good taste decorations and the outside of the apt is a beautiful garden is beyond compare. I and my husband have a unforgettable night here.  Michael is literally gentleman with warm heart and charming personality. He gave us lots of useful advices and helps. If you want have a romantic Chicago journey, Michael’s apartment is the best best choice. Small tips for you:  if you want to host a small party here, I highly recommend that asking Michael first and better rent the upstairs apartment at same time( there is a upstairs bedroom need to be shared with others). ",1.0
Chicago,"The whole place is idyllic. The flowers are beautiful, the roof is a perfect place for a slow morning. The entire living space is full of beautiful art, and unique items that make the space wonderful to just look around and take in.   Plenty of pillows per bed, fresh sheets, and also other things! New tooth brushes in a drawer (perfect because my significant other forgot theirs at home!) and shampoo/conditioner (so I didn't have to skimp with my tiny travel-sized bottles).   Shared space is great to hang out and chat with other people, and separate room/loft is great to retreat to when you need to rest and recharge on your own!   Also all of the flowers are even more bright and beautiful than in the photos. wonderful place. Centrally located. Tons of good food nearby, and so many interesting things are easy to grab a Lyft or walk to.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a great Chicago adventure!",1.0
Chicago,We loved our stay at Michael's super cool loft. The deck was AMAZING. Michael was super fun to talk to and let us just sit out on his porch and enjoy the flowers even after we checked out. There was water and fresh lemon slices waiting on our nightstand and really unique art all over the place. Staying here really added to our Chicago visit. Totally recommend!,1.0

",1.0
Chicago,"Michael is the kind of host I hope everyone gets to encounter through airbnb. He is perfectly welcoming, doesn't overlook details, and truly made my stay in Chicago special. I loved that I could drop my bags earlier in the day before check-in to go exploring sans-baggage. Same was true for the day of my check-out - Mike kindly allowed me to leave my bags, go for a run, and then come back and shower before catching my flight out of the city.   As for the space: it is stunning. My bed was extremely comfortable, in-room shower/vanity/toilet was great, plenty of outlets to charge your technology, I was lacking nothing. There was water with a few lemon slices waiting for me on the night stand - again no details were missed.   Bottom line: Excellent value. Perfectly outfitted space with the charm and character that defines the ideal airbnb experience. If it's available during your stay, book it. ",1.0
Chicago,"Michael's  space was stunning, we had a hard time exploring Chicago because his space was one of our favorites in the city.  Good people surround themselves  with good people and Mike embodies hospitality and passion for good people.",1.0
Chicago,"Michael's place is not a room at the Swissôtel, and possibly not for everyone, but that could only be their loss. A large, bright, airy space atop 19th-century brick buildings just a few blocks north of the river. Inventive, comfortable, clean, but well-loved spaces, interesting objects everywhere, a generous and characterful host in Michael, and, in warm months, a spectacular (huge!) roof garden from which to contemplate (or escape) the city around you. A rare treat.",1.0
Chicago,This was by far the best air bnb we have stayed at yet! It’s in an incredible location for a super reasonable price.

We would happily stay here again and recommend it to friends. Thanks, Michael!",1.0
Chicago,"“I like to spoil my guests” said Mike and that’s the truth. Lovely, luxurious bedsheets, plenty of towels, organic soaps/shampoo/lotions and potions.   Mike is a wonderful host. He clearly loves hosting people. He is open with his space and you will feel very welcome and at home.   The space is eclectic and clean. The deck is beautiful. My 22m old son and I had a wonderful time. If we ever find ourselves in Chicago again we will be back!",1.0

Chicago,"We really enjoyed our night at Michaels place.  Great location for walking right into the heart of downtown.

Chicago,This was definitly a different experience. It was more like living in a community. It was great for us and Michael answered quickly to all questions and remarks. There is a big terrace with a great view over the city and it was nice sitting there after a long day in the city and just let the day end with a beer or cocktail.  The apartment was clean with a nice rain shower in the main bathroom. The room we booked has a small bathroom inside the room but no one had a problem when we used the main bathroom as well. Everything was really uncomplicated. The apartment is directly in the middle of downtown. It never took long to go anywhere. ,1.0

I had the pleasure in staying the private back room, it was spacious and the in-room bathroom was a great addition. The loft is centrally located so its really easy to get around anywhere and very easy to get to/from the airport. This is the first airbnb I've stayed in that the host exceeded the house, and thats saying a lot because the home was amazing!

Chicago,"Michael and his place was a great stay!   Michael was very accommodating and helpful with our late arrival and with anything we needed.  The only thing to be aware of is the noise level of surrounding bars on a Thursday night, if you are a light sleeper.  I always carry ear plugs and had no problem.  My girlfriend is a heavy sleeper and had no issues.",1.0
Chicago,"Michael has an absolutely amazing space, and it is unlike any other that I have ever stayed in before! It is within walking distance to so many key attractions. I highly enjoyed the Architectural River Boat Tour that was less than half a mile away. The deck space that he has created is top notch, and he is a very accommodating host. The space has beautiful natural lighting, and the most comfortable bed. I will be recommending his place to anyone heading to Chicago, and I will definitely be back for another stay! Thanks again, Michael!",1.0
Chicago,"Michael's place was AWESOME. It was cozy, clean and very welcoming. Take special note that you have to walk up 5 flights of stairs but it is worth it for what waits at the top. Shhh! It's a surprise.  Michael was wonderful for waiting up because I arrived at 1am.",1.0

Chicago,"If you don't have health or happiness issues with walking up five flights of stair, you should have a fantastic time staying at Michael's loft. I'm 59 and my partner is 64 and we did not have any problems and we were fascinated with Michael's creative use of the space.",1.0
Chicago,"Michael is the consummate host because he is friendly, caring, considerate, and a wealth of knowledge about the art and architecture in and about Chicago.

Bus and train stations to major attractions only 2 blocks away.  the loft is a great unique experience that is off the beaten path of staying in a regular hotel, but much much cheaper yet still offers a great vacation experience.  Michael was very accommodating in many ways. offered very good recommendations on what places to go to for dinner and drinks. Would definitely stay again.",1.0
Chicago,"Loved the artist loft ambiance. Our room was very comfortable, with both a king and single bed, along with a private bathroom. The neighborhood is bursting with restaurants and nightlife (but we were not at all bothered by any noise). Although Michael’s place is close to transit, we found that it was easy and enjoyable to walk instead. The River Walk, downtown shopping, theaters and so many Chicago attractions are accessible by walking. Michael was very responsive, and made it easy to get to and into his place. Thinking it would be a great place for a warm weather trip back to Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"Best Airbnb I've ever been to! First timer here in Chicago, and Michael's loft is truly special. The king size bed was cozy and warm. We enjoyed lounging about on the stylish couches and enjoyed the night view from the rooftop. Short walking distance from all the hot spots. We didn't get to meet Michael personally,  but he was very responsive via messages checking and mak in ng sure we made it okay. He sent us suggestions on places to visit. I will recommend this Airbnb to everyone who comes to Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"I was in and out for only one night. This place is huge. There is a long hallway in the middle that connects two listings, and this is one of them. I didn't know about that before, and neither did the other party, so we were surprised by each other, much to our amusement. But other than that, it's a neat loft. I can only imagine the view of the deck in summertime; it was rainy, windy, and cold when I stayed. I'm sure the view is spectacular in warmer weather. Recommended.",1.0

I would give my highest recommendation for Mikes place! You will not regret staying here.",1.0
Chicago,"Michael's place is really a gem in the city. It is unique in its coziness and quirkiness despite being in the middle of all the nightlife. Just the entire place, I was in awe of the art, furniture, and architectural styles in the loft. We slept very well, didn't hear any noise from the nightlife, traffic etc despite being downtown. What really blew me away was the way he allowed our dog (golden doodle) to roam around the apartment and treated him as if he were his own. Our dog is very energetic and curious, sometimes people don't like that especially in their space. Michael played and kept our dog company while we went out and our dog really took a liking to him and the space. Michael is a very generous host, placing bottled water in the room, extra towels to be used, and offering use of his kitchen ware for eating. Would definitely stay again next time we are in Chicago.",1.0

Chicago,"We absolutely loved  Michael’s place.  The very huge Loft is artistically and tastefully furnished. The wide roofgarden filled with a hundred of flowerpots is the best location during breakfast and evening hang out . We ate breakfast there (when it didn’t rain)and drink wine on the  Sofa like an extended living room under the moonlight during evening with fantastic sound of Michael’s music collection . From the roof top you can see the numerous restaurants and bars around , but Michael‘s rooftop offers the best location , so why still going to a bar?  We had fun and laughed a lot with Michael especially when we ate and had drinks together whether at his kitchen bar or at the roofgarden . He is a very cool , accommodating and friendly person.Likewise his son Todd  who lives on the third floor helped us on our arrival carry up our heavy luggage , and Michael got up so early to help us carry down our suitcase on our departure day.  Sorry for that Michael .  Should we come to visit Chicago again sometime , we definitely will stay again in his place. And by the way those new 4 recently refurbished rooms are so beautiful with individual bathrooms ; high ceilings and have an early 20th century style .  It was a great pleasure to have stayed in your place Michael . We did enjoyed your company . See you again,,,",1.0

Chicago,"This is how all Airbnb’s should be ! Superb host, great location and a real and lively apartment full of art (made by himself) and Art Deco accessories that Michael collects. Communication with Michael was perfect. He kindly asked me if I would be willing to stay in the “curtain room” as there was also an older couple staying there who preferred to sleep in the room without having to climb up some extra stairs. Guess what; this room was actually even better. A real “loft-feeling” in this room on a split level facing the great high windows in the front of the apartment. In the middle of River North, where it’s lively, but never hostile till late at night. Some earplugs (available in appt) and a great bed were all I needed to enjoy my sleep and wake up fresh in the morning to enjoy Chicago once again. Whenever I come back to Chicago this would be my preferred place to stay (again!)",1.0
Chicago,"Michael is a great host. Even though we haven't seen him that much because we were out really early and away all day, he made or staying really comfortable.

Chicago,"房子的地理位置非常好,交通便利｡房东是一位非常有品味的艺术家,把房子布置的很漂亮,可能因为我们是冬天去的原因,没有看到鲜花盛开的露台,夏天去应该会非常的美｡同时,房东人很热情,会介绍附近的景点和餐厅,都是非常不错的地方,值得前往逛逛｡我们住的房间是两张床的房间,设施俱全,但因为位置靠内,景观不是太好｡推荐入住1张大床的阁楼房间,通风性也更好｡ The location of the house is very good and the transportation is convenient. Landlord is an artist, the house is decorated very beautiful, because we went to Chicago inwinter, we did not see the flowers blooming terrace, I saw the pictures,it's very beautiful in summer. Meanwhile, the landlord is very enthusiastic, he introduced the nearby attractions and restaurants, all very good places to visit. The room we stayed in was a two-bed room with all the facilities, but the view was not so good because it was inside. I recommend you to book the one-bed room with good view.",1.0
Chicago,Comfortable space enough for two people. Nala and Owen provide all the necessities for a comfortable stay. They are great with communication and check-in is fairly simple. There is noise from the downstairs bar but the bed was so comfortable I quickly got passed it. Be careful with parking... I got a ticket. Regardless it was a pleasant stay and I definitely recommend!,1.0
Chicago,Great location and affordable price. Like many others have said the bar noise isn't much of an issue and can be easily drowned out by the noise make. The only complaint we had was the mattress seemed a little old and felt like it was bowl shaped because of prior use. Other than that everything else was perfect!,1.0
Chicago,Very tidy and lovely Airbnb apartment equipped with everything you need. A comfortable bed and clean bathroom. Nala & Owen are great host and there when you need them. We had a great stay! Thank you Nala & Owen.,1.0
Chicago,"Lovely place to stay if you want to experience Uptown Chicago. Nala & Owen were excellent hosts! Also, the subway was located right next to the apartment which was very convenient. I highly recommend this place if you want to experience a different area of Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,Nala's place was great! It was just one block away from the Red Line which was super convenient for my commute to Downtown every morning. Super easy check-in and communication. I would definitely stay here again!,1.0
Chicago,Nala and Owen were amazing hosts! They provided great details on check-in and suggestions for restaurants and activities in the area. We stayed here on a Friday night and the sound from the bar was a complete non-issue.  Would definitely stay here again!,1.0
Chicago,"The place was adorable! Check in was easy. There is a full kitchen with everything you could need. We were there on a Thursday night, but weren't bothered at all by the bar downstairs. Wouldn't have even know it was there if it wasn't in the listing. They were very helpful with nearby restaurants and take out options. Would definitely recommend! Thanks again!",1.0
Chicago,"Great location right off the Trainline...  very convenient, had everything we needed.  The room was nice, bed was comfy. Perfect for going to Cubs games! Train only 2 stops from Wrigley!  Thanks for the hospitality! We would stay again!  We got a warm welcome and “Chicago handshake” from Nicks! (The bar below)",1.0
Chicago,"Great 3 days stay at this beautiful cozy apartment with easy check in and great location. The apartment itself is super clean and has all the listed supplies. The bar at downstairs did make some sound at late night but if you are not a extremely light sleeper, you will be totally fine.  The red line train is just 1 minute away by walk and we were able to easily visited all the places we wanted to go. Would definitely book this place again if we come back to Chicago next time.",1.0
Chicago,"A great location and we found free parking about 3 blocks away! The music from the bar wasnt terrible....however the noise from people talking loudly and laughing on the sidewalk outside the bar went on until about 6 a.m. which is what kept me up most, but I'm a light sleeper so that may be why. We did have an issue getting back into our place due to the magnetic reader not reading our fob properly, so I had to call Nala at 830 at night, which was kind of a pain to look up the number, but she gave us a code to use so that was good. All in all a pleasurable experience.",1.0
Chicago,"Great cozy place with easy access to the red line which made a difference for us while using the CTA. Great central location. The bed was sooo comfortable I even took a pic so I can get the same one in the future. Level of the bar didn’t bother us a bit, the sound machine they have mostly got rid of the noise. Would definitely stay here again.",1.0
Chicago,"The bar downstairs was not a problem, but we were also out pretty late all 4 nights we were there  VERY convenient to the “L” (red line)  Target is right around the corner and there’s a 7-11 store right downstairs too",1.0
Chicago,"Nala & Owen were great guests! Their place exceeded our expectations! So close to the red line and so convenient! We went to a cubs game and it was conveniently two stops away from the field! Also, we didn’t even pay attention to the noise from the bar! It was minimal if even noticeable! I would recommend this place to anyone!",1.0
Chicago,"Very nice space. It had everything you could possibly need for your stay. If you want peace and quiet this may not be the space for you since there is a bar right underneath and patrons will not shy away from being loud. Personally, the noise didn’t affect my sister and I at all. We still got good sleep.  Everything else was perfect and I would definitely stay here again.",1.0
Chicago,"What can I say? The location of this stay is great. Parking was easy to find and was easy to get in. The bed was so comfy and everything provide allowed our night stay to be amazing. Would definitely stay again, and would recommend to everyone.",1.0
Chicago,"Our stay in Chicago was so great! The apartment was spotless and super cute! The bed was super comfy and very cozy! There was some noise from the bar, but we brought along a louder fan and couldn’t hear it. Parking was a little hard to find but the host did suggest a great app to help us find some! I would recommend staying here to anyone!",1.0
Chicago,"This is a very cozy spot. The bar noise isn't really an issue. However, there are tons of people on the street that have no problem screaming at all hours of the day. Other than that I highly recommend!",1.0
Chicago,"The loft is cozy and comfortable! Very quaint and I loved the furnishings! The bar noise was not a problem, I heard it once or twice but it wasn't an issue for me. Nala and Owen have exceptional hospitality and their communication is quick and precise! I reccomend your stay here.",1.0
Chicago,"We had a wonderful stay at Nala & Owen's place! Location made it easy to hop on the L, their recommendations and tips of the area were a great help and we hardly noticed sound from the bar below. If anything, the near-by fire station made the most noise, but that's part of the city life and we would stay here again in a heartbeat!",1.0
Chicago,Nala’s place was so adorable! The bed is beyond comfy and the noise from the bar below was not an issue at all. The sound machine provided was incredibly helpful and lulled us right to sleep. 2 minute walk to the train which is very convenient!,1.0
Chicago,"This flat is exactly as described, great aesthetic and sparkling clean.  As other reviews mention, it is right above a bar that plays loud music from 4pm to 4am.  If you are a light sleeper I would not recommend this Airbnb.  If the thump of bass doesn’t keep you awake I would definitely recommend, it didn’t bother us much.  It is a great location to many coffee shops, restaraunts, and walking distance from The Riv if you’re seeing a show.  The Red Line train is right across the street for easy access into the city.  Great communication before and during our stay!",1.0
Chicago,"This space is gorgeous and conveniently located right next to the Red Line (but there’s plenty of great stuff in the neighborhood too). It’s easy to find and check in to, but it is located right above a bar and you can definitely hear music until 4am. Some white noise helps drown it out but if you have any aversion to noise at night it’s probably not the best. But the space itself is great, cozy, and clean!",1.0
Chicago,"Nala's place was a great find for us! We attended a concert at Riveria Theatre and were thrilled that it was less than a 10 minute walk away. Not only that but the red line is very close nearby and there is a 7 Eleven right next to the apartment. As for the space, it looks exactly like the pictures provided. The bed was sooo comfortable. The noise level from the bar is hardly noticeable. However, we could hear some bar-goers talking very loudly outside. We are used to sleeping with a fan on, so that helped to block out the noise tremendously. We would definitely stay here again.",1.0
Chicago,"This apartment was fantastic. The decorations were very stylish. The space is really well utilized, with everything you could need for a comfortable stay. The bed is very comfortable. The wifi is fast. The location was great, with an easy walk to Aldi and the train. I had no trouble finding free parking, though I stayed during the work week so the case may be different for a weekend stay. As far as the noise level went, I found the music from the bar to be less noticeable than the ambient city noise. The apartment is located near a fire station, and one day there must have been a particularly high number of fires. Otherwise, I wasn't bothered, though I can be a sound sleeper, so a pair of ear plugs to sleep with might not hurt if you are a light sleeper. I would definitely stay here again.",1.0
Chicago,"Nala and Owen’s place is absolutely beautiful! I was wowed by how clean and neat everything in the apartment was. I only spent a night, but it was comfy and I had the privacy I needed. -I did not utilize the kitchen, but it has everything you need if you want to use it.  -Flatscreen tv is excellent -I wanted to melt in the shower with how amazing it was..  -Slept like a baby in the bed and the sheets were extremely soft  Nala checked in on me after arriving, during my stay, and after. I would definitely consider coming back!   -Regarding the noise, I slept through a large majority and was exhausted, but could be an issue for light sleepers unless they use the white noise machine.   Thank you, Nala and Owen!",1.0
Chicago,"Nala and Johanna have a really beautiful space in Uptown Chicago. It was my first visit and I didn’t feel the least bit disconnected from the city. The bar downstairs is a fun little spot! We could hear the music, just like the description stated, but we slept right through it, and I’m an incredibly light sleeper. Not much more than the vibrating bass line of the songs playing. The bedding and mattress were EXTREMELY comfortable, and the space was just the right size for my wife and myself. The pictures do the space justice, and the styling was actually very inspiring for what styling I would like to do with my bedroom at home. It is important to note that the bathroom, though styled beautifully and modern, has a very small shower. But that’s neither here, nor there. The communication from Johanna throughout the stay was more than helpful, we felt completely at ease and confident in coming and going. This flat is beautiful, and the next time I am in Chicago, I would most definitely stay again. I would live there if I could.",1.0
Chicago,The host was extremely helpful with communication. The host gave me a list of things to do around the area. The noise from the bar was not an issue falling asleep but it was noticeable. I would recommend staying here as I will stay here again.,1.0
Chicago,"This place was immaculately clean and the bed linens and bath towels were exceptional. The studio is very well appointed. The noise was what one may expect on a busy urban street. Would stay here again. Very close to the red line, Wilson station. Very convenient after dinner and theater downtown.",1.0
Chicago,"Nalas place is amazing!! Right off the red line it is super convienent to travel. The bar below is no problem at all, didn’t bother us one bit. Check in is super easy and the place is so cute! We had everything we needed and nala is super helpful, she gave us some great suggestions for local activities. :)",1.0
Chicago,"We had a great time staying at this airbnb during our 5 day trip to Chicago! It’s super close to the red line train and the little bar downstairs has a super cute and welcoming atmosphere! We weren’t bothered by the bar noise when we used the noise cancelling machine provided in the room. The target and Dunkin’ Donuts down the street we’re great to have nearby as well. All in all, a great location at a decent price!",1.0
Chicago,"The place was spotless and very calming to be in. Even though the bar was directly underneath the apartment, it was not very noisy. There was some music that you could hear if you payed clothe attention and stayed completely silent. That being said sleeping was not an issue with the noise from the bar, and having a bar super close by is a nice option to have  after a long trip!   Overall we enjoyed the stay and would definitely consider again when we come back to Chicago!",1.0
Chicago,"This was the perfect spot for going to see a concert at the Aragon Ballroom- only a couple blocks away. The spot was cute and very clean, which was great. Though over the bar, the noise coming from the bar was minimal and wasn't super noticeable. We would both stay here again for another concert!",1.0
Chicago,"We loved staying at this apartment! It was incredibly clean and comfortable. The bar was a little noisy, but we knew that going in and ended up not even noticing it the second night.  Overall it was a great place to stay!!!",1.0
Chicago,"What a perfect place for a long weekend in Chicago!  Great neighborhood, well appointed apartment with everything we needed.  It's across the street from the L, so it was unbelievably easy to get in and out of downtown for shows and restaurants.  Checking in was straightforward and easy, Nala was really open and available.  All in all, a really great stay.  As for the bar downstairs, you can hear the muffled music at night, but we put on the noise machine and slept through it and weren't bothered by it.  That said, I could imagine that light sleepers might have a tougher time, so that's just something to know.  For us, it was a perfect spot--would definitely come back!",1.0
Chicago,"We loved our stay at Nala’s place. It was comfortable, super cute, and perfect for a quick in and out stay for a show at the Aragon Ballroom. The only negative is the sound from the bar downstairs, but Nala makes that very clear in the description of the place and in the check-in details. So, it might not be the best place for a light sleeper! That said, we would definitely stay there again!",1.0
Chicago,"Nala's place is absolutely perfect. We felt like one of the locals in this studio apartment, and we both already decided we're keeping this in mind for our next trip!  Some great points: - Decor is adorable. Especially loved the bamboo shades to block out the street lamps. - Amenities are spot on. Coffee, shampoo, you name it.  - Area is great. Close to public transport and found free street parking close by. We also loved having the 7-Eleven right below us! - Speaking of businesses below, don't worry about the noise from the pub. It was plenty muffled, and if you still find yourself struggling to sleep, there's the white noise machine!",1.0
Chicago,"Such an amazing find, you will not be unsatisfied with this flat. Safe feeling neighborhood plenty of nearby places to eat or drink. The sound from the bar is barely even audible, so don't get too worried about this when booking.",1.0
Chicago,"This stay met every expectation. Super cute decor, immaculately clean, extremely comfortable bed, could have stayed in that warm shower for hours, easy check-in, found free parking, and walking distance from venue. Even the food suggestion (Tank Noodle) was great!!! If I ever come back for a concert at Aragon Ballroom I plan on staying here!",1.0
Chicago,"The location is on point. Parking is not so bad, I was able to find parking right next to the building & for free. The place is above a bar but it truly isn’t bothersome, I was able to sleep. The communication was great & all questions were answered with no troubles. Enjoyed my stay here, I definitely recommend this place. It is also right next to 7 eleven where I could get amenities needed.",1.0
Chicago,"Clean! Stylish! Great Location!  I am looking forward to my next stay here. Clear directions are provided upon reservation, making the check in process seamless. Felt at home upon entering the door. The studio is clean and nicely maintened, and I enjoyed the homely touches throughout. Because of its prime location you are close to just about everything Chicago has to offer (great food, entertainment, CTA, and Lake Michigan). This place is my new go to when I visit Chicago!",1.0
Chicago,"Nala’s place was so beautiful, and located in a wonderful area! So many delicious restaurants within walking distance, and being a few steps away from trains and buses was so convenient! The apartment is above a bar, but I’m a heavier sleeper so I didn’t even notice. My friend who stayed with me is a light sleeper and while she was a little uncomfortable the first night, she got used to it and barely heard the music after that. The next time I’m in Chicago, I’m definitely going to try and book this Airbnb again!",1.0
Chicago,Nala’s Place was perfect for our nights stay in Chi-Town. We stopped downstairs to Nicks on Wilson for a drink and 7-11 which is also downstairs for a snack before bed. You really couldn’t hear the music too much from upstairs. It was very muffled. The bed had to be the most comfortable we’ve slept in in years. There was Netflix on the big flat screen which was a plus. The parking was easier than expected as well. We would definitely stay again.,1.0
Chicago,"The studio was a perfect size for two people. There is loud music playing from the bar downstairs but Nala makes that clear prior to booking. Everything was clean, and she offered some suggestions on local places to eat. Also great for grabbing a bite and staying in with the Netflix she provides!  Access to local eateries, bars, were a breeze and major plus that it is across the street from the Wilson train stop on the red line. Quick commute into downtown Chicago - would def stay if visiting the city again.",1.0
Chicago,We had an amazing time staying at Nala’s place. She was a very thoughtful host and made sure we got everything needed for our stay. The place was super cute and clean as well! Highly recommend! Thank you again!,1.0
Chicago,"Great stay and perfect location for show at Riviera Theatre! Our request for additional towels was accommodated. As mentioned in the description of the location, there was some noise from the bar but it didn't really bother us. Might not be for light sleepers. Would love to stay again for events in the future!",1.0
Chicago,"Great place to stay, and Nala is a great host!  The space was very clean and beautifully decorated.  The pictures describe it well.  We felt very safe and secure inside the apartment.  Nala was very communicative and transparent with us throughout our stay.  We noticed the music from the downstairs bar, but it definitely did not bother our sleep.  I would definitely stay here again.",1.0
Chicago,"This place is awesome! Great area and the value is unbeatable. The space itself is clean and really spacious for just an apartment. The hot water pressure is fantastic, perfect after a long day! The bed is so soft and the tv comes with Netflix! Despite being near a bar, I had no problems with peace and quiet. Didn’t even notice any raucous. The WiFi was speedy and check in was easy! Any questions I had were promptly answered and Nala had recommendations on local places to go! I recommend over easy cafe, get the french toast! Don’t hesitate to stay here, it’s great!!",1.0
Chicago,"I had a great experience staying here during my Chicago trip. While the lock was a bit tricky to figure out at first, I was able to call the number given to me and get an immediate response and assistance. The apartment was nicely decorated, the bed was comfortable and the shower was fantastic! I was able to take a short Uber trip to get to wherever I needed to go. I would highly recommend staying here if you're looking to visit Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"Overall amazing stay! IMMACULATE.   It was a little difficult to navigate the lock box in the dark, and the instructions (verbal and written) were inaccurate at times. Once I figured it out it was a breeze. Beautiful space.",1.0
Chicago,"Nala’s superhost badge is well deserved! She was very accommodating and communicative to ensure that our stay at her place was everything it needed to be, and she even offered local tips for dining and entertainment. It was in such a great location, as we were staying just blocks away from the Riviera Theatre where we attended a concert. Before booking, I did read other reviews talking about the bar below and the noise level. Nala had a white noise machine available to use, but to be completely honest, we did not even need to use it! The bed was so comfortable and the apartment was very clean & stylish. If we are ever in town for  another show, Nala’s will be the first place we look into, and you should as well. You will not be disappointed!",1.0
Chicago,"With quick and easy access to the “L” train Nala’s flat brought the huge city of Chicago into arms reach, even for a public transportation rookie like me. The flat was clean and modern, the bed was amazingly soft. The building itself was quite, neighbors where all very polite.  There is chatter and music from the bar downstairs but not at any level that kept us up. The white noise machine was a big help.",1.0
Chicago,"Nala's place is a nice, cozy space. It is super close to public transportation, a post office, salons, a boutique, some tasty eateries and murals. It is about a 30 minute ride on the train to the city center, which isn't bad at all. There is a bar below that can play music until 5am and some patrons that hang outside to smoke for a little. If you are a super light sleeper, this is not the place for you. The noise did not bother me one bit and Nala provides white noise machines just in case the noise is a bit bothersome. The bed is super comfortable and the kitchenette is great for heating up some food or making something small. Nala is also helpful and communicates with you in you in advance of your trip so all is well. Overall, I loved the style, location, and convenience of Nala's studio.  Nala is a great host; I would love to stay here again!",1.0
Chicago,"I had an awesome first time experience! I have never used airbnb before, and to be honest I was skeptical. This apartment was perfect, exactly as described and as pictured. It is cozy and modern with a very comfortable bed.   I may have failed to mention to my partner who is a light sleeper the close proximity (right above) to a bustling bar. The noise level on a scale of 0-10 is probably at a 2-2.5. My partner woke me up the first night asking me what the far away bumping bass was... so for me not an issue... for some it’s a bother.  I will say that we did happen hear a very awkward couple break up outside , so if you’re sensitive to noise then this may not be for you.. but then again if that’s the case then in general cities may not be for you either.   Overall I would certainly stay here again and would recommend others to as well. There are parking options all around and is very close to transit... and close to a VERY delicious local donut shop.",1.0
Chicago,"Overall, our experience was great. Proximity to the El can’t be beat. Took a minute to get inside the building and had difficulty getting back in later (buildings security box gave us an issue,) but we notified our host and were called back immediately with some quick instructions and no longer had an issue.   The studio was spotless and smelled great; the bed had some gentle scent that was really nice and it was super comfortable. Decor was true to photos. Towels, shampoo/soap, fridge, plates etc are available which was nice.   As stated in the advertisement, place is above a bar and 7-11. It was surprisingly louder than expected for a Thursday night but more mild Friday night lol. I’ll also say we had just come from a high rise downtown that was beyond quiet, so every noise stood out. There was a large tv with Netflix at Nala’s as well as a white noise box on the bedside table. With that background noise, it drowned out the bar noise.   All in all, for the price and <20 min train ride downtown, it’s a no brainer.",1.0
Chicago,"This was my first time staying at an Airbnb, and my experience was great! The entire place was sparkling clean, the room was very stylish, the bed was comfy, and it was in a good location. I also really appreciated all of the tips from Nala, especially about parking. I am not super familiar with parking in large cities, so her tip to use ParqEx helped us tremendously.   As far as the noise from the bar located below the apartment, it was a little bit more disruptive than I was hoping. Luckily, we brought a loud fan with us so we had no issues getting to sleep. If you’re a light sleeper and have a fan, just bring it, and you’ll have no issues. Because the bar closed before we got up, it was no problem for us the next morning.   Overall, I really enjoyed my stay and would totally recommend staying here if you come to Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,This studio in Uptown was very quaint and cozy and had all the necessary touches to make it feel like a home away from home. The host was easy to communicate with and super prompt in replying.   Re: the noise level from the bar below. It wasn’t too bothersome when the air conditioning was on but it was noticeable when the air conditioning would turn off as I am a light sleeper. I couldn’t figure out how to get the sound machine to work otherwise I’m sure the noise would have been unnoticeable throughout the whole night.,1.0
Chicago,This cute little studio apartment made us feel one with the city of Chicago! We used to parking lot that Nala recommended- it was just a few blocks down the street. It was easy and convenient. Loved every second of our stay!,1.0
Chicago,This was our first air bnb that we stayed at and it definitely was a great experience. The studio apartment was very nice and clean. We were new to the area and Nala provided us a list of places to eat/things to do in the area which was very helpful. We could hear the music from the bar which is located right below but it was not overpowering and we were still able to sleep. Before booking the air bnb it states that there is a bar below so we knew we might be able to hear it a bit. Overall the place is great and we definitely recommend it to others.,1.0
Chicago,I had a great experience at Nala’s Place. There is a little noise below the apartment but it was not bothersome. Also they provide a white noise maker on the nightstand if needed. Very cute place and everyone was helpful.,1.0
Chicago,"Was great staying here, unfortunately there was a storm so I had no WIFI but that wasn't a big deal. Everything was nice and clean and well decorated. There were some weird banging noises happening during the morning though but I couldn't point it out where it was coming from but it sounded like it was in the apartment- maybe it was a freak incident. But overall, I'd stay here again!",1.0
Chicago,"We loved our stay at Nala’s place!  The space was clean and the bed comfortable. Very close to the red line making public transportation a breeze. Like she said in the description, there is a bar downstairs and you can sometimes hear the bass from the music but we didn’t notice it very much. Then again, we were there on weekdays, so the weekends might be a different story. She’s very quick to respond to any questions or comments. Will definitely consider her place again when back in Chicago!",1.0
Chicago,Location was fantastic! Super close to the  train. The space was stylish and well put together. I could reach the host at all times and very quickly. We enjoyed our stay and would stay again! Thanks Nala!,1.0
Chicago,"This place was amazing. The unit is extraordinarily clean with modern and stylish furniture. The bed is more comfortable than my bed at home. There is a bar below, but we barely heard anything, even without the provided noise canceling speaker. We parked about two blocks down and used the train/Uber for transportation, the red line is less than a 4 minute walk. The neighborhood wasn’t awful but wasn’t the best either, we opted for the Uber after midnight. Just be aware of your surroundings and you’ll be fine! 10/10 would stay here again and can’t wait for our next trip to Chicago! ",1.0
Chicago,"Gorgeous and comfy! And an amazing location, too! My boyfriend and I enjoyed our stay here so much and we plan on staying here again when we come back to Chicago. Even though it’s above a bar, we didn’t have any disruptions to our sleep or any loud noises. It’s right next to the L station and there’s a 7/11 right below. Great, great location!",1.0
Chicago,"This is a great AirBNB in Chicago. We were going to concerts at Wrigley Field. You are a Short uber or train ride from Wrigley && many other areas. It is a good location, very clean, and great bed. Convenient free parking across the street. The bar noise did not bother us. We even went to Nick’s one night and the people were very friendly. As with any area of Chicago, you must be careful but we never felt unsafe and there are many well lit streets for walking. ",1.0
Chicago,"Very Well maintained, and spacious studio apartment. The apartment is located above a bar, so it can be noisy at night (the host fully disclosed this). It was fine, because we enjoy staying out late at night:)",1.0

As she noted in her description, it is located above a bar but we weren't bothered at all by the muted sounds. She also provided a white noise machine as a thoughtful touch, too! Nala was very quick to respond to messages and her instructions for getting into the apartment were easy to follow. Would definitely stay here again!",1.0
Chicago,"Nala’s place was clean & simple & in an excellent neighborhood! The washer/dryer came in clutch for us.   We had some late nights while we were in Chicago so the location above a bar was fine for us — I might not recommend if you’re there for serious R&R.   Nala was a caring and communicative host, it was clear she wanted our trip to be absolutely perfect. And it was!",1.0
Chicago,"Truly beautiful apartment. When I had a problem, Nala and her team of assistants helped me in a matter of minutes. The neighborhood was safe. The noise was not bad at all (slept soundly); I forgot there was a bar on the first floor. I visit Chicago once a year and I found my new place to stay. Thanks for being an excellent host!",1.0
Chicago,"Definitely the cleanest space with the most comfortable bed we have ever slept on. I am sad to leave it behind. Clean kitchen, super clean bathroom, giant tv. As far as the neighborhood, it was nice & accommodating with plenty of coffee and vegan food nearby. The subway is super close and this made for an easy time getting around. The noise from the bar below was minimal, but I brought earplugs just in case and slept like a baby. Thanks for the hospitality!",1.0
Chicago,"Nala is a great host! The door to get in the place was a bit tricky but once I made it inside it was incredibly clean, not a spot or speck of dust. The bedding was all extremely clean and comfortable. There is a bar below the apartment but the noise was not extremely noticable. ",1.0
Chicago,Nala's place is amazing. It is brand new and stylish while providing a very comfortable and homey feeling. Check-in and check-out were super easy and Nala is very responsive to any requests/ emails. The bar downstairs is noisy but if you are not a very light sleeper it is not a big issue. Or just bring a pair of ear plugs ;) Proximity to the L is amazing and makes the commute downtown or any other neighbourhood super easy. Overall amazing experience.,1.0
Chicago,"This is a MUST STAY spot in Chicago! If you're looking for the perfect spot to rest in the middle of exploring such an amazing, high energy city - this airbnb is your oasis.

Chicago,"This place was perfect for our stay in Uptown Chicago. It's right across from the L train station,  which was quite convenient and Nala provided very clear check-in instructions and tips on places to go in the neighborhood.    Nala was very honest about the noise level we might expect from the bar downstairs. My partner is a sensitive sleeper and always brings earplugs, and he slept great both nights we were there. Very comfortable bed, plenty of pillows, air conditioned, and very clean.   Nala provided everything we might need in the kitchen and bathroom. And the flat screen television with Netflix was nice.   We would definitely stay here again, and recommend this place to others!  Cheers, Nala ",1.0
Chicago,Nala's place was just right for what you needed if your heading to Chicago since it is located right beside the subway. All attractions in Chicago are easily accessible from the apartment. I would definitely stay there again!,1.0
Chicago,"Stayed in this beautiful place and was really impressed by the amenities provided by the host. The place is clean and has a TV with Netflix!! The coffee machine is good. The place is few meters away from the Red Line, which makes it easy to commute to Downtown where my office is. The host is prompt in responding to me and very friendly. The bar below the apartment didn't disturb me in my sleep, the apartment is 90% soundproof. I would suggest everyone staying here, and if I come back to Chicago next, I would like to stay again. Thanks Nala...Cheers!!",1.0
Chicago,"The place was perfect ! You can really feel that the host put careful attention to making the place not only aesthetically pleasing but super comfortable! Very clean, spacious, and location was good for getting around the city (close to Blue train line and near bus stops). Highly recommend. It was a perfect example of the unique benefits of Airbnb over hotels",1.0
Chicago,"This was our first experience with AirBnB and we were very unsure how it would compare to a traditional hotel that we're more comfortable with. After our time at Natalia's, I doubt we'll ever go back to the old way! She was very fast at responding to our messages and checked with us to make sure everything was going well. Check in was very easy and the space had so many thoughtful touches to make our time pleasant. Highly recommend!",1.0
Chicago,"Natalia's place is a perfect sanctuary in a great neighborhood. The apartment is clean, beautiful, peaceful, and replete with everything you need for a weekend away. My husband and I were very happy with location (close to the Blue Line, and amazing bars and restaurants), and the chic, minimalist aesthetic of the flat. Would stay here again, and have recommended it to our Chicago buddies for their out-of-town guests.",1.0
Chicago,"Natalia goes above and beyond to make the space feel like a home away from home. The location is amazing; near to great food & coffee. The kitchen, bathroom, living room, and bedrooms are fully stocked with everything you could need. I wish I could've stayed longer!",1.0
Chicago,This location has everything to make your stay in Chicago over the top. The location is great; whether you want to enjoy the wonderful food or just need easy access to the subway and rest of the city. My partner and I had a fantastic experience and you will too.  Natalia exemplifies everything a superhost should be. Her recommendations and knowledge are off the charts and will certainly enrich your experience.,1.0
Chicago,"First about the host Natalia and the apartment -- we give both our highest marks. Communication was great, and check-in/check-out was a breeze. The apartment is at appears in the pictures, and you'll feel cozy and at home.  As to the neighborhood - it too was fantastic. The apartment is quiet at night while you're trying to rest, but there is plenty of nightlife nearby if that is your thing. Longman and Eagle has one of the most extensive whiskey lists I've ever seen. Definitely heed Natalia's advice about nearby restaurants. I will say this: The breakfast/brunch game in Logan Square is over the top. There is not a single place we regret visiting.  Logistically, the Blue Line is a short walk away and you can reach pretty much anywhere you need to go with ease. If you're flying into O'Hare, the neighborhood is just a short ride away.  No negative marks, no words of caution for this location, apartment, or host.  Thanks Natalia for a great stay!",1.0
Chicago,"Adorable one-bedroom apartment very close to the Logan Square restaurant scene. Natalia’s place was clean, stylish and full of everything I needed. I felt safe and comfortable during my stay, and the neighborhood was very walkable and convenient.",1.0
Chicago,"This one bedroom apartment is an Air BnBer’s dream.  We have stayed in Air BnBs around the world and this is among the best.   Clearly, the home’s owner thought through everything that a guest might need.  We arrived to find coffee and tea waiting, which was perfect after a long day of travel.   The apartment is clean, spacious, well located and very, very comfortable.  It is the best Ikea styling I have ever seen in real life. In fact, Ikea would do well to stage a photo shoot here.  The furniture, the decoration, the artwork are all simple, yet we felt like we could move right in and live here as a forever home.  •	The bed is like a cozy nest (loved the pillows).   •	The kitchen (and the fridge in particular) were sparkling clean.  It was stocked with more than the basics, which was great since we always shop for breakfast food when we arrive in a new city, and found a Trader Joe’s quite nearby. •	There is a little office with many kinds of connectors for phones and computers •	The living room couch is really comfortable, and there’s a lap blanket for cuddling up.   •	The bathroom was outfitted with much more than we needed.  The towels were soft and fluffy and there were plenty of them. •	The lights and heat are controlled by a Nest system with sensors to turn lights come on and off as you enter and leave a room.  That no doubt helps with the energy use but it takes a little human adjustment  We ended up taping over the bathroom light sensor so it didn’t blast on in the middle of the night when one of us wandered into the bathroom. •	The building is on a busy main street, which concerned us as we arrived -- I am very sensitive to noise. But once inside, the apartment is completely quiet.  If the weather had been warm enough to open windows, it might have been noisier, but we didn’t test it out.   •	Street parking is a little competitive and cars have to be moved off the street in the later afternoon when the parking lane becomes a traffic lane.  This was not an issue for us since we were gone pretty much all day long.  Everything was as it was presented by Natalia, who was a thoughtful and attentive hostess.  We were in town to help our daughter move into an apartment walking distance from the Air BnB.  We hope to stay here again on return visits.",1.0
Chicago,Natalia's space is GORGEOUS -- it's both warm/cozy and clean/minimalist. It's very spacious and decorated beautifully (while also being extremely comfortable). A very nice place to stay if you're traveling to Chicago for work (like me) and need a quiet space to come back to or if you want to cuddle up and read or watch a movie after a long day of exploring the city.,1.0
Chicago,My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Natalia’s place. The place was extremely clean and we appreciate the thoughtful amenities and decor.

Chicago,"Natalia’s place had everything we needed for our long weekend in Chicago. It was so easy to explore the food offerings in Logan Square from here, and the quick walk to the blue line was great for getting there from the airport and around the rest of the city. The decor and lighting made for a great environment to hang out in, too!",1.0
Chicago,"I took a Chicago staycation to finish my book and Natalia's second-floor apartment was the perfect getaway. It was more than roomy for me, being just one traveler, but I loved the amount of space and light she creates in your classic Chicago ""long-but-not-wide"" floorplan. There was more than enough light and her cheerful plants and art made me feel right at home. Small touches like a welcome note, snacks, and a guide to the neighborhood were wonderful and I actually found two amazing eateries during my stay thanks to her helpful guidance.  Water was always hot. Automatic lights and Nest heat made me feel spoiled. And there were ample towels, toiletries, and plateware to be found. I literally rolled in with my suitcase and I was home.  If I were to make any change, it would be the small addition of having more blankets or comforters available. The heat in the apartment was perfect but I like to sleep under many layers at night (I struggle with this at hotels too!).",1.0
Chicago,"Natalia’s apartment was very cute and much bigger than I expected it to be. I loved how homey it felt. The couch was extremely comfortable, and so was the bed. Easy checkin, and Natalia was very thorough with instructions. The location is perfect. We walked to a lot of places (even in -5 degree weather) super clean, too.",1.0
Chicago,"This was hands down the best airbnb I’ve ever stayed at. It’s a beautiful apartment that was an absolute pleasure to stay at. I had a good amount of work to do and Natalia’s place was the perfect environment for this. Beyond comfortable, an absolute joy. And Natalia was very communicative and helpful throughout my stay.",1.0
Chicago,Absolutely loved this place. Very stylish and comfortable. You can tell that Natalia put in the time to make her guests feel welcome and safe. She also was quick to respond to any questions I had and checked up on my friend and I to see if we needed anything. Check-in/out was also speedy and simple. Would definitely recommend.,1.0
Chicago,"Natalia's place was wonderful.  A great location near the highway and easy street parking in front of the building.  Easily drove to downtown in 10 minutes.  What makes this place special are the little details Natalia puts into her home to make her guests comfortable.  Little things such as: available communication and checking in on us, snacks for guests, a guidebook of the home and recommended spots in the area, and modern touches to an older home such as Nest Security and Hue Lights.  A highly recommended place with an outstanding host.",1.0

Highly recommend Natalia’s apartment for your trip to Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"Natalia’s place was perfect for the price and just as described. Logan’s Square was a little out of the way for the work I had to do, but i didn’t mind. It’s a fantastic area with a lot to do around there and the apartment was really quiet at night (which was most important to me as I’m a light sleeper).",1.0
Chicago,Natalia's apartment was the perfect space for my fiance and I to spend a few days in Chicago.

Natalia was a very kind host and checked in on us during our stay to make sure everything was going well. I would definitely suggest this AirBNB. ",1.0
Chicago,Natalia's place was absolutely perfect for our 5 day trip to Chicago. The apartment was very clean and it had all the necessary amenities we needed. The Nest air conditioning system was clutch as it was very hot and humid in Chicago.

She was very quick to respond to my inquiries and requests.  I definitely recommend staying here.,1.0

Chicago,"Natalia was an excellent host - quick to communicate and gave us lots of great recommendations for the area. The apartment was about a 10 minute walk to the blue line and some amazing restaurants.

The place was also sparkling clean and looked as it does in the listing. ",1.0

Chicago,"Gorgeous bright apartment perfect for a long weekend! Loved my stay at Natalia’s place. Walkable to restaurants and nightlife in the heart of Logan Square, and only a few transit stops away from other main commercial areas. There’s a Divvy bikeshare station right by, which made for a great bike adventure through Chicago. The apartment was spacious, very clean, and well decorated with plants. Central AC was a plus too given the 90+ degree weather. Would definitely stay again!",1.0
Chicago,"Natalia’s place is gorgeous!! The place is very clean and has great style. Check in and check out was a breeze, Natalia is very accommodating to your needs and she even checks in the make sure you have all that you need.

The apt is really close to many restaurants, bars and public transportation which made everything easy for us to get around.   The apartment itself is very stylish and cozy. It made it feel like home away from home. I would love to stay here again!!",1.0
Chicago,"We arrived several hours early and was exploring until our 3PM check-in. Natalia messaged us to check on our status. She then gave us the option to check in earlier than 3PM! We ended up exploring and arriving around 2:45PM. Her willingness to accommodate us made us feel very welcomed. Many Airbnb hosts are very rigid about check in times, so we really appreciated her kind gesture.   We felt very welcomed and relaxed in Natalia's space, because of her tasteful minimalist interior design. There is a lot of thought put into the amenities such as the automatic heating, automatic lights, and everything was squeaky clean.   If you want to explore the local hidden gems of Logan Square, then you should stay at Natalia's space. The neighborhood is charming and she has a whole list of recommendations for guests to explore! It's also very close to the subway station. Thank you, Natalia, for your hospitality!",1.0

Chicago,Natalia’s place was an urban oasis. The apartment was well stoked with everything you could need and more. It was exceptionally clean and the bed was very comfortable.

Chicago,"Our stay at Natalia’s was wonderful and we’d come back again - it was as pictured but even better in person. We loved all the plants, the way it was furnished, a very unique space and very comfortable and clean. We enjoyed the coffee, the automatic lighting and smart heating, and little touches like the book with suggestions and handwritten welcome. The area is great too - there’s lots of restaurants and cute shops nearby. Uncharted books was a favourite of ours. In our opinion it was nice to stay out of downtown yet still close to anything you may need. Natalia was also a great host she communicated clearly and even checked in with us to make sure all was well. Thanks Natalia!",1.0

Chicago,"The place is very clean and quiet. Joe is very welcoming to us. The only minor issue is that the lock was broken on the bathroom door due to a past incident that hasn’t been fixed during our stay, but Joe offered us to use his bathroom as an alternative. Another thing worth noting is that there’s no lock on the bedroom door. Not sure if I missed that information in the description but that came as a surprise for us. Other than that overall it was a good experience. Great value for a stay in Chicago.",1.0

Chicago,"This was my first time staying with a superhost, and Joe certainly lived up to the designation. We got in late and he was kind, helpful, and communicated promptly and clearly. The beds and linens were super comfortable, very nicely made. We had intended to leave earlier,but slept in till checkout because we were so comfy. Nice shower and spa tub with a skylight. I met Joe in the morning and he was a charming, lovely person..I really appreciated him making us so welcome. The location is good for access to downtown. We drove a few minutes, parked near the station, and caught a train that got us to the heart of the city in 30 minutes. I heartily recommend staying here, only wish we had for more than one night!",1.0
Chicago,This was a great place for me to stay for a night. Location is very convenient for those planning to go to the airport. Downtown is an hour away through bus and train (blue line) together.

Chicago,"Joe was absolutely amazing! He responded promptly and was one of the nicest people I have ever met. He made sure we had everything that we needed and definitely exceeded our expectations. We went to a concert that was suppose to be a block from his house but the venue got moved to a further location and Joe offered to drive us. He did NOT need to do this, he told us to cancel our uber! It was an unreal experience and could not have asked for anything. He also has an enormous amount of knowledge of the city including restuarants, culture, etc. I would book another trip with him in a heartbeat.",1.0

Chicago,Joe’s place was great! It is simply decorated with all the basic amenities. It is clean and comfortable. Joe is so endearing and kind. Ask him anything! He is happy to provide any help he can. We enjoyed our stay and will definitely stay here again when in Chicago.

Chicago,"Joe was absolutely everything a super host should be! friendly, polite, intelligent. knows how to read people/situations. he is willing to chat, or give you your space. speaking of space - Joe's place was clean, homey, and had great lighting. accomadating is an understatement. ",1.0

Chicago,Joe is a friendly host who will go the extra mile to help make your stay in his home enjoyable.  His location is perfect for the traveler who is taking advantage of Chicago's great public transportation system. I recommend the 7 day Ventra card to hop on any bus or L train any time you want. The price is very reasonable for a comfortable bed and your own bathroom. I would stay here again! ,1.0
Chicago,"Joe's place is a great place to stay! The bedroom is very simple with a big bed for two, two chairs, a full length mirror, a bedside table, and a lamp. There are six outlets, and although only four of them work, that's plenty for one room. The bathroom is clean, and the shower has great temperature control. The shower can also be a jacuzzi, which is fun. The towels he provides are very soft and very plentiful. Joe was having some electrical issues in the bathroom, so he put in a lamp. However, in the daytime, sun shines in through the skylight, providing natural light in the bathroom. He provides full use of his kitchen, even offering eggs, bread, and lots of pots, pans, and kitchen utensils. We kept a deep-dish pizza in his refrigerator and microwaved it in the morning to eat, using his kitchen knives and plates. We didn't use the living room too much but the seats looked very nice. The floors were clean enough that I walked around barefoot without an issue. The house was temperature controlled and the door had a keyless entry number pad. The best part of the stay was Joe himself. He is a sweet man who is very willing to chat and share his life experiences with his guests. Being kind of young, we were a bit apprehensive about meeting him, but he put us at ease completely. He was completely un-creepy, which can sometimes be hard to find in older men as an East Asian - American. I appreciated his conversation and his excitement at sharing the house with us. He's a lovely, kind man who doesn't unnecessarily interfere with his guests and makes sure that we treat the house as if we were his roommates. I felt at ease and well rested at Joe's place!",1.0
Chicago,"Joe’s place was perfect. Joe himself was a wonderful host, very caring and clean. I stopped on my way to Michigan and it was such a comfortable stay. I had to order something off amazon last minute and he even let me send it to his place, and even though it arrived a day before my check-in date, he was kind enough to take care of it until I got there. Would recommend. Thanks joe!",1.0
Chicago,"Joe is such a good host! He is clean and polite, moreover his house is in front of the bus stop so it's easy to get to the airport or to the downtown. The neighborhood is calm and full of nice restaurants. It was such a pleasure to stay with him and I recommend him.",1.0
Chicago,"If you are looking for a place close to Chicago O'Hare airport area, book Joe's place with your eyes closed! While his place is advertised as one private room with one bed, Joe makes another bed available in the living room depending on the needs of the guest. This was hugely helpful for us. Joe is a perfect host, makes the guests comfortable in a jiffy, answers all questions very promptly, and more importantly, very knowledgeable about the area and Chicago in general since he has lived in the area for a very long time. If you have a car, it's easy to find a free parking spot on the street outside. If you need to use public transportation, there is a CTA bus stop right outside the house (you come down the steps and the bus stop is literally right there).

Apart from its great location as both the airport and the city center are 20 minutes depending on the traffic, you can have everything as if you were in your own home as we had a living room, full kitchen and private bathroom, Joe was spectacular in all the aspects. It was always that we occupied it for any consultation, conversation or to take us to the hospital when our daughter got sick. We would recommend it 100% since he is a wonderful person.",1.0

I love this place and definitely would stay again – it's very conveniently located to El (train) and bus lines but is quiet and peaceful.",1.0

Chicago,"Min's place is a cute, cozy little apartment in a convenient location; walking distance to the L-trains, Wrigley Field, Kingston Mines, and great places to eat. This was our first time to Chicago. Min helped us out with suggestions and tips to enjoy our time and offered bag check so we could do a tour on the morning before we left. The only downside I found was a limited counter space for my makeup in the bathroom. The bed is super supportive with comfy linens and pillows.  There was lots of closet space and plenty of towels and wash clothes - always a plus in my mind! It snowed on Sunday so the shower was nice and warm after tromping around in the windy snow.   Thanks for a great time Min!",1.0

It's the perfect size in a quiet neighborhood but not an expensive uber ride to Michigan Ave. We also took the bus to Wrigley (stop is close by) but we walked home and it was an easy 20 minute walk. The place was clean, and he had the basic amenities as well which was appreciated. (Hair dryer, shampoo, toothpaste, body wash, plenty of towels, coffee, tea and even popcorn!) We were gone most of the day, but at night enjoyed the comforts of his place including a very comfortable bed, couch, large tv, roku, mini fridge for our leftovers..etc.) Check-in was a breeze, and Min also gave us suggestions for things around his place. Next time I'm back in Chicago, I would definitely try to stay here again!",1.0

I would have stayed 12 more days had I known how comfortable that bed is. Everything was so clean and tidy. Couldn’t have asked for a better Chicago night, thanks Min!",1.0
Chicago,"What a great Airbnb! I had booked this a couple of months ago and forgot to look at the photos again before I checked in, so it was a nice surprise when I arrived and I saw how modern yet comfortable the apartment is. Min was there to check me in and explained everything very concisely. It was really cold out but the heating worked perfectly and there were extra blankets. The bed was great too and I slept quite well. The only thing missing is a kitchen sink but there’s a nice little set-up in the living room with a microwave, fridge, and a Keurig coffeemaker. The location was great too – walking distance to a lot of restaurants.  I definitely would stay here again!",1.0
Chicago,"Min’s home is quaint, cozy, and equipped for even the coldest weekend in Chicago! We were greeted and welcomed by Min himself.

As a guest you have your own entrance, control of the thermostat, and a ton of storage. The space is used very well in this home and doesn’t leave you feeling cramped. Min’s home is located a few blocks from restaurants, bars, and some light shopping (Target, Trader Joe’s, TJ Maxx, Urban Outfitters). The train station is a short walk away from the home making it a convenient place to stay if you’re not wanting to be in the city. We felt incredibly safe and welcomed in Min’s home.

Apparently the main heat wasn’t working, but I couldn’t even tell. Ewa had placed a space heater in the bedroom and the fire place in the living room gave off good heat. So it was nice and cozy despite the blizzard that was happening outside.   Ewa also gave me quite a few suggestions about things in the neighborhood to do, places to eat, and how to get around. This was also at 10pm when I arrived. I appreciated that she took the time to check me in even though it was late.   I ended up not having to stay both nights I booked.

Easy walk to the L and more food. Highly recommend, you'll be happy here.",1.0

Chicago,"Our stay at Ewa's apt was Five star perfect. She met us on arrival, parking was EZ in a gated yard in the back, the entrance is on the side of Thomas st a pretty treelined street of Townhouses and Apt buildings. We drove from New England to spent Christmas with our son, who has a new Apt on Division street. Driving afforded me to bring  way to much stuff. Christmas gifts, wrapping paper, my travel table top Christmas tree, I forgot the apt is on the second floor. Ewa was the perfect host, quick to size up the situation, she picked up the two over stuffed carry ons and headed up the stairs, the rest was easy. The apt is very attractive and comfortable filled with Art. While there is no kitchen she has a nice table with chairs, microwave, frig, coffeemaker with filters and Starbucks Breakfast Blend also a nice choice of tea's. The bathroom is equally attractive with everything you might need ,extra toilet paper plenty of soap, shampoo etc. There are two mirrored sliding door closets, one in the bedroom and one in the front hall with a small useable safe in it. The bedroom is a nice size with a comfortable bed pretty white cotton sheets and plenty of blankets. The apt was set at 70 which is hot for me but the thermostat is behind the bedroom door easy to adjust. There are nice big windows looking out on Thomas st with beautiful wooden blinds.

Chicago,"The apartment is absolutely gorgeous, surprisingly spacious. We definitely took advantage of the hot water kettle for tea every morning and yummy candies. We also used the microwave and refrigerator which was so convenient. Even though the apartment doesn’t have a proper kitchen, Ewa provides almost everything you’d need, even a cutting board, a wine opener, etc.   The neighborhood is really cool, kind of a hipster vibe with interesting stores and plenty of food options. I wish we had more time to explore that area more but we ended up spending most of our time downtown and at the pier, which was a short 10 - 20 min lyft ride, depending on if we were doing a pool or not. Ewa was super attentive and so kind. She let us check in early and also leave our bags in her office until we had to leave for our flights. She also checked in with us during the trip. The only thing I wish I had asked at the beginning was how to adjust the thermostat because it got pretty cold sometimes, but thankfully the apartment is stocked with plenty of blankets.  I highly recommend this place!!",1.0

Chicago,We loved this place. The location was awesome and Ewa was such a great host!! So kind and efficient. Loved being surrounded by cool art. It was such a great experience. Definitely would stay here again and recommend it to friends.,1.0
Chicago,"This is a really great place- totally a steal. All the furniture and bathroom, etc were high-end and it was very warm (it was winter so this was a welcome change to other places we stayed!). Ewa is a great communicator, was prompt and flexible. Loved that it was in/part of an art gallery, how fun! Parking is off the street and very easy. Would absolutely stay again, one of our favorite Airbnb's thus far.",1.0
Chicago,"Definitely one of my top AirBnb experience. Ewa was a great host and the apartment was perfect. Beautiful neighbourhood. Our hosts really wanted us to feel at home. The apartment is decorated with art pieces from the owners’ art gallery. There were snacks and refreshments. Ewa made a point to welcome us in person, gave us local tips. There’s free parking. Highly recommend!",1.0
Chicago,I am so glad I stayed here. The building is AMAZING! I loved all the artwork and the historical background. This unit has beautiful high ceilings and a nice bathroom. The host is AMAZING!

I’ll defineitly stay here again when I come back to Chicago.,1.0

Chicago,"Ewa’s place in Chicago was perfect! The private parking lot in the back was a major plus and the area was very safe and trendy with lots of shops and restaurants up Milwuakee Ave. Ewa provided many different amenities when we checked in and lots of useful local tips. The room itself was decorated nicely and had VERY high ceilings which I loved. Even though the apartment was on a busy street, no outside noise could be heard from inside the apartment. Overall great experience and would definitely come back again!! Thank you Ewa!",1.0
Chicago,"Ewa was super friendly and helpful. Checking in was super easy, although it was nice that I had a call/ text plan because we had to physically meet to get the keys, but I'm sure she would have worked with us if that wasn't an option. Overall would definitely recommend if you are looking for a simple but nice room in a great location",1.0
Chicago,"Space was as advertised. It was more spacious than I had imagined, and very high ceilings! The amenities were good, and there were lots of thoughtful touches. It was a very comfortable launch pad for activities and in a great location. The mattress and bedding were comfortable and clean! It is very private, quiet, and safe. Great area! Ewa is a lovely and kind host. We would definitely stay here again, with our pup.",1.0
Chicago,"We loved our stay at Rod’s place. The view is amazing, but the location and amenities are even more amazing. Roosevelt station with 3 lines are just around the corner, as well as Trader Joe’s, Wallmart, and lots of eating places. Field Museum, Shedd Aquarium and Planetarium also within walking distance.  The gym, pool and spa are 5 star hotel quality. Safe neighborhood and building too.",1.0
Chicago,I cannot day enough good things about both this apartment and the host! Rod answered questions immediately and was extremely accommodating! The view is not even real! I could have sat inside and just looked out the window the whole time! We will be back again!!,1.0
Chicago,"As said by just about everyone else, the view is AMAZING! Everything in the apartment was so nice and clean. We were so close to so many great restaurants and parks. We walked to just about everything we did. The amenities were far better than any hotel. Rod was so nice and helpful anytime we needed it! I could not recommend this apartment enough!",1.0
Chicago,"Quiet enough  Great views of Chicago, you can see Roosevelt university and wills towers through your room window. Tv is big and has many fun things to watch Sofa is soft  Bed is comfortable. But the kitchen staffs is a little bit dirty, maybe you have to watch it again when you come.",1.0
Chicago,"Rod’s place was better than what we had expected. Not only did the apartment have an amazing view, there was a lounge/rooftop on the 40th floor with even more great views of the city. Check in was easy. And the place is within walking distance of a lot of the main attractions. Highly recommend this place.",1.0
Chicago,"Just like everyone else said, the view is spectacular. This apt is sparkling clean and breathtakingly beautiful. I was in Chicago for a work meeting and loved coming back in the evenings to this comfortable, homely, beautiful apt. I had no trouble getting in each time.. the women at the front desk were all friendly (I made a point of saying hello to each of them so they were greeting me like old friends after 2 days). It's close to everything - small market just 200 feet away allowed me to stock the fridge. I highly recommend Rod and his lovely apt.",1.0
Chicago,Amazing views and a really great location. Close to the train stop and easy to get all over the city from this location. We had a great stay here at his place and would definitely recommend staying here for your next vacation or business trip. The gym is fantastic if you enjoy working out.,1.0

Chicago,"Rod’s place is exactly as advertised! The view is great, and Rod makes it easy to communicate with and gets back to you in a very timely manner. Rod worked with our schedule and allowed us to check in hours early! The view is absolutely gorgeous and would love to stay here again my next trip to Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"If you are from Chicago and know Chicago and ever go back to Chicago- this is the place to be. It is in the heart of where everything happens and a short uber  ride to all the clubs and restaurants in River north. Overnight parking is not only attached to the condo but it’s the least I’ve ever paid for parking in downtown. The view speaks for itself, no need to comment there. Does have washer and dryer in condo and bathroom could be a room all in itself. Am definitely coming  back and hope availability is still there. So please don’t book July 3rd-9th :).   Thank you Rod, amazing place!",1.0
Chicago,"This place was incredible! Rod was a fantastic communicator which made it easy for any questions we had. The apartment was absolutely incredible!

Chicago,"Lovely modern Apartment with an amazing view - good Shopping possibilities around and a great diner if you are too lazy to cook. extremely ""speedy"" communication - clear, professional and superfast- many thanks Rod. I look forward to being back",1.0
Chicago,This was probably one of the best airbnbs I’ve stayed at. It was in a great location (close to everything) and not to mention the views ! The place was clean. Rod was always  available to answer any questions I had. I did not want to leave Rod’s place at the end of my trip.,1.0
Chicago,"First of all, every review that addresses the amazing view is absolutely correct; it is astonishing! On my first morning I woke up to watch the sunrise. The bed is extremely comfortable with extra blankets available to accommodate preferences. In town for business, this apartment had everything I needed. Rod communicates clearly and follows up to make sure your stay is going well. I highly recommend!",1.0
Chicago,Amazing spot at such short notice! Rod was such a nice and communicative host and was able to accommodate us literally six hours after booking... which I normally never book trips in such short notice but he was able to help us out and I am so glad he did! Everything about this spot was 100.,1.0
Chicago,"Rod’s apartment was so clean and so modern, it had the greatest view. It was super close to all the good places.Rod was a wonderful host and would respond to your msg right away . Me and my boyfriend had a blast there and I’m so happy we chose this place.",1.0
Chicago,"Rod’s apartment is the perfect getaway destination with an amazing view. While everything looked awesome from his pictures, I was still not prepared for the view when we arrived. Rod was extremely hospitable going out of his way to make sure we had the perfect stay. This apartment is in a great location if you want to get around Chicago—public transportation is right around the corner, and there are plenty of close markets and eateries. Rod was always just a shout away and always responded quickly to any questions. I know where we’re staying next time we come to Chicago!",1.0
Chicago,"Our experience at this apartment was amazing. The building has many great amenities like a gym, coffee machine, and large rooftop lounge. Rod was an extremely responsive and accommodating host. Check in was super easy and quick. The apartment had everything we needed and then some. The in-room conveniences like a washing machine, dishwasher, and full kitchen, were very useful. Next to the building were some great local markets and restaurants that have anything you could need. This apartment offers a wonderful way to experience Chicago. Nothing compares to seeing the spectacular Chicago skyline from sunrise to sunset from your bed.",1.0
Chicago,"We have had an incredible trip! Rod’s apartment was perfect. His description and photos of the apartment painted an incredible picture and it still exceeded our expectations. The location couldn’t have been better as we were just a few steps from public transportation and a market for groceries was right at the corner.   Even when we came inside to escape the rain, we had a spectacular view of the city.  The whole building was super clean, comfortable, stylish, and safe. Rod was always super quick to respond to any questions we had and gave us great recommendations for local restaurants. We would love to stay here again next time we’re in Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"As someone traveling solo for a work conference, Rod's modern, stylish, and highly functional apartment with excellent views was the perfect spot for working and resting. It was nice to have a comfortable ""home"" space where I could cook light meals, drink tea, and chill out with a cozy blanket. Way more appealing than the more expensive conference hotel down the street! The apartment had fast internet, great movie/media selections, a desk for working, a great bathroom with large shower, and all the small bits like ample hangers and shelf space in the closet, iron/ironing board, and washer/dryer that can be so helpful for work trips. I would also recommend this space for a couple and would definitely stay here again when I come back to Chicago in the future.",1.0
Chicago,This place was very easy to find. There is a open parking spot about a block behind which was very cheap for 3 days. The apartment was very clean and comfortable. It had everything we needed. The view is spectacular. Go to the rooftop which has even better view. Rod was a great host who responded quickly to every question i had. I definitely recommend this place.,1.0
Chicago,"Rod is dedicated to a great experience for his guests. His responsiveness and hands on approach throughout the rental period put him above and beyond the average host. He cares about his unit and his guests, the overall experience and it shows through his direct approach.",1.0
Chicago,"Lovely apartment with a spectacular view of the Chicago skyline.  The amenities are top-notch for the area and the location is easily walkable to Millenium Park, Soldier Field, museums, and shopping.  Rod was quick to reply and easy to get in touch with.  We stayed for a week, but would have been comfortable for a month.  We will absolutely seek out Rod's place on our next visit to Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,the view is even better than what is shown in the listing. i would spend time every night before sleeping just watching the clouds go by the skyscrapers in the view (that you can see from the bed). beyond that the listing is very accurate. just look at the pics and read the description and you'll know what you are getting. i would stay there again. my wife mentions that the orientation of the apartment is such that you can sleep in without shades being down since the sun doesn't blast you in the morning. laundry is in unit and works well.,1.0
Chicago,"Stunning view& great for couples in the heart Chicago.  Rooftop and 5th floor are super added spaces.  Location is near many Chicago famous sites and area has numerous restaurants including Chi Town staples of deep dish pizza and Chicago hot dogs.  Rod's place is clean, modern and functional.  You can use the public transport for quick access to all of downtown Chicago.  Rod's location is in the midst of a number of colleges in the area so the area takes on a young, lively atmosphere.  Grocery stores including Trader Joe's within walking distance.  Plus if you like dogs, this area of town is pooch city, lots of owners and dogs walking about.  Rod communicates quickly and efficiently.  We will book again.",1.0

Chicago,"We enjoyed our stay at Rod's place! The pictures are accurate, and the view is truly amazing. The apartment was clean, and we loved the amenities such as the outdoor pool, the game room with pool table, the gym, and the roof deck where we could see the Navy Pier fireworks in the distance. The location worked well. Not far from the subway, walking distance to many attractions, and several restaurants and convenience stores right there in case we needed something. We did not meet Rod, but he communicated almost immediately when we had questions, offered helpful tips with public transit, and his check-in directions were clear. Very happy with this experience!",1.0
Chicago,"Great location and very walkable to the museum/aquarium/waterfront. Superb views of the city and the building has really nice amenities. Interior is clean/modern and furnishings are simple. Advice If you are a “princess and the pea” type sleeper, bring a sleep mask (curtains are pretty shear and sun rises early in Chicago in the summer) and ear plugs for the L train, which rumbles through pretty continuously. Overall a great stay!",1.0
Chicago,"First of all, the view is outstanding! The apartment is cozy and very sophisticated. Everything was clean and exactly like the pictures. Check in was easy, and parking was available in a parking deck close by. While we didn’t meet Rod in person, He was very attentive at getting back to me about all questions concerns. He also had lots of great suggestions for places to eat and things to do nearby.  We would highly recommend!",1.0
Chicago,Rod’s apartment is everything captured in the description and more. Truly amazing views from the space and everyone we met there was super friendly. We were close enough to walk to the museum campus with Shedd Aquarium and Field museum in no time. And there were so many options for dining etc that if we wanted to we could have stayed right on our street. But of course it’s Chicago so we had to venture out and try different things. Rod’s apartment made a great base of operations however and was the perfect place to go back to at night and take in the views. You won’t be disappointed by staying here in the least. We didn’t want to leave!!,1.0
Chicago,"I have stayed in many airbnbs in many countries, and this is probably the best experience I have had. We got to Chicago late and the host responded quickly, check in and out was excellent. The apartment is lovely. Would definitely recommend and stay here again.",1.0
Chicago,Check in and out process was very smooth. Rod does a great job at communicating and getting back to you at a timely manner. The apartment was beautiful. The view is amazing.

Chicago,"My stay here was awesome! The view each day - sunset, night skyline was just beautiful. Rod was quick to respond to my emails.  I really enjoyed staying here. Highly recommend this place. I hope to stay here again!",1.0
Chicago,"We were pleasantly surprised at the simple and clean set up of Rods apartment, but the actual view of the city was absolutely beautiful day or night. Being located in the South Loop it was perfectly located within walking distance of the Loop attractions without being right in the middle of the St Patty’s day drunken weekend. Rods place offfered hotel size shampoo and conditioner and a comfortable atmosphere. The apartment complex itself features a pool that’s open in the summer, and a whole floor of fitness, a pool table/rec room, Starbucks coffee machine, computer, and other outdoor shared patio space on the 5th floor. Overall it was an extremely enjoyable stay and I’d definitely come back again!",1.0
Chicago,"We absolutely loved our stay at Rod’s place. The building, the location, and the view was incredible. The pictures truly don’t do the view justice.

Chicago,"Rod was a gracious and friendly host.  He was easy to contact via email or text.  We were astonished by the the amazing view!  I stared out those windows morning and night.  Wow!  The apartment is beautiful and cozy. The sleeping accommodations were very comfortable.  My son and I ate at the desk. (Rod had two desk chairs but only had one bar stool.) Rod gave me a great tip on parking.  I was surprised what great access the apartment had to buses, trains and subway.  I hope we get to visit again!",1.0
Chicago,"Fantastic place to stay.  Bed is comfy, view is great, within walking and reasonable lyft distance of most things.   The gym is huge, the place has a space with a pool table/xbox/other games.  Wonderful airbnb experience",1.0
Chicago,"I gaurantee if you book this house, that will be one of the best choices you’ve ever done for that year. View was magnificant, and house was cozy and warm. One thing I felt bad about was the owner Rod’s picture skill because I am telling you it is much better than the picture and you will have a great time in this house. (Sorry Rod!)",1.0
Chicago,"Rod’s place is absolutely incredible. It’s walking distance from The Field Museum, Shedd Aquarium, and Adler Planetarium. It’s about a mile walk from the Bean and Millenium Park. The amenities are wonderful and the view is absolutely breathtaking. Waking up each morning or getting home every night and seeing the Chicago skyline was one of the highlights of our trip. Would definitely recommend this place to everyone!",1.0
Chicago,"Location was great, very central and well connected. Great view from the apartment. The building and its facilities are incredible. During the summer must be even better as you would be able to use bbqs and pool outside! Rod has been always available to answer any question!",1.0
Chicago,It’s an amazing apartment with a stunning view. It’s close to public transportation and when you like walking the downtown isn’t too far either. Rod is responds really quick and he was cooperative to let us check in a bit earlier.   I totally recommend staying at his palace and we would definitely stay there again.,1.0
Chicago,Sometimes the pictures look too good to be true. But that view is really the best! I got so many people asking me how I got such a great view for such an affordable price. My son and I walked to the Shedd Aquarium two days in a row (about 18 minutes). This place is in such a convenient location. Grocery stores and restaurants all around. I hope to return no-weekly. Five stars all around!,1.0
Chicago,"The apartment was clean and just as pictured.  I was told that the shower was small but I though it was good size and I’m a pretty big guy.  The only issue that we found was with the neighborhood.  This part of Uptown is not really good for exploring and because of the bar and the 7/11 at the entrance you will have people begging for money or cigarettes every time you leave or enter.  I was told that the bar might keep us awake but we had absolutely no issues with this, however, we were only there Monday thru Wednesday so it may be different on the weekends.  All and all of you are just using this for a place to sleep or you are early to bed this place is perfect.  Also, if you are in town for a Cubs game as we were this place is perfect.  If is a block away for the L and it is two stops from Wrigley. However if you want to explore near your room or are up late maybe not the best neighborhood for you.  Either way the hosts and the room are great.",1.0
Chicago,"This location is so convenient for the CTA, and we found street parking for free without any trouble. The space is lovely and well-appointed, and clean as a whistle. We'll absolutely stay again if it's available.",1.0
Chicago,"Came with my boyfriend for a concert at the Aragon Ballroom, it was the perfect walking distance to the ballroom. It was raining that night so if needed, the apartment is also very close to the L which can take you to the Loop and any other neighborhood you need to get to. We would definitely stay here again!",1.0
Chicago,Nala and Owen’s place was such a gem! It was within close proximity to so many wonderful restaurants and bars as well as the red line station! The place was very charming and the tips from the hosts were more than helpful! We really had a wonderful trip!,1.0
Chicago,A very beautiful place. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The apartment was sparkling clean with a comfy bed and other stylish decor. Would definitely recommend and return. Hosts are very warm and welcoming.,1.0
Chicago,"This place was absolutely spotless clean when we arrived.  Everything immaculate.  Plenty of space for a couple.  Great bathroom/shower.  Bed was soooo comfy with super soft linens.  The bar noise did not bother us, you could super slightly hear it if you were very quiet but the noise machine took care of that no problem. Location was perfect for a concert at the Riviera.  Thanks to the great hosts!",1.0
Chicago,My stay was nothing short of amazing at this place. The apartment is located within one block of a red line CTA station. Two blocks away is a Target and on the first floor there’s a 7-Eleven. The place was flawless when I arrived and I loved the self check-in process.  I saw a few reviewers mention noise but I didn’t find anything to be loud. Just standard city sounds. The apartment comes equipped with everything so it feels like home.,1.0
Chicago,"Great place. Within walking distance to Aldi, Target, Dunkin, and, most importantly, the Riviera Theater. There is some noise from the bar downstairs, but no problem for people who sleep with white noise or the TV on. Honestly, not really any louder than what you'd expect for staying in any big city. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!",1.0
Chicago,"Napa & Owen’s place was a wonderful space to getaway. It’s simple, functional and very stylish. It is over a great bar, and right next to a convenience store so everything is right there. They were great at giving us some local places to try and we had no issues with sleeping over the bar. I would recommend to anyone! Loved it",1.0
Chicago,"Extremely clean and well thought out place. Had everything we needed and wanted, but didn’t feel lived in or cluttered.  The location is fantastic, steps away from a new and well-lit Red Line stop. Getting just about anywhere in the city is a breeze without having to use Uber.   The neighborhood is spotty and seems to be undergoing a pretty rapid face lift. The immediate area around the room is fine, but we heard the other side of the train stop should be avoided late at night. But getting to and from the train from the apartment never felt sketchy, even past midnight.   We didn’t explore much of the neighborhood by foot, but did stop in at the bar below (Nick’s on Wilson) and found it to be a really clean and chill spot with affordable drinks and friendly bartenders. Wish we’d given it a shot earlier in our stay.  The noise from the bar below is definitely noticeable, but with the white noise machine cranked up and comfortable bed we slept really well without issue.  If we come back to Chicago this is where we will stay. Great value and perfect for experiencing the city from a resident’s perspective.",1.0
Chicago,"We went up to Chicago for a show at the Riviera and the location of the apartment was so convenient, a few blocks walk from the theater. It was very clean and modern but also comfortable and cozy. All the amenities We could need and more. Communication and check-in/out was seemless. I highly suggest staying here if you are visiting uptown Chicago for any reason. There was a small amount of music noise from the bar below but with the white noise machine provided I fell right to sleep and stayed asleep all night because that bed is seriously comfy! Thanks for the stay! If I find myself in the area for an event again, I’ll stay here for sure!",1.0
Chicago,"The hosts are proactive about a positive experience for their guests. We are grateful for every effort to communicate with us about what to expect and what we might do.  This space is perfect for a couple looking to have a comfortable place right next to CTA (Red Line) and other transportation options. The bed and pillows and linens were comfy, the shower was terrific and the kitchenette gave us options.  We would book this place again!",1.0
Chicago,"If you're looking for a great spot in uptown Chicago that is close to nightlife, great food, and the Riviera- this is the spot! Very comfy and stylish, great shower. Tons of stuff to do within walking distance or a very short uber ride. I liked that the hosts afforded their guests privacy, check in and check out was very easy. 10/10 Would stay again next time I go to Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"Nala and Owen’s place is perfect for a weekend trip! The apartment was so cozy and tidy. They warn of the music from the bar downstairs although they provide a sound machine which helps so much! The apartment is within walking distance of many restaurants and the Rivieria Theatre, and the train stop is right outside the front door. We can’t wait to stay again, maybe in the Summer when it isn’t so chilly outside!",1.0
Chicago,"Total hidden gem!! Wonderful contemporary, clean minimalist style easy to get comfortable. Its perfectly located on the redline making it easy to get everywhere.  My boyfriend is a light sleeper and we were prepared for “bar noise” and it was FAR less than stated on the listing, we both slept comfortably straight through the night.  I will be reserving this space again if it is available for my future visits! I couldn’t have asked for a better place for the location and price!!!",1.0
Chicago,"This place is perfect for someone who’s never been to the Windy City!! The L is right across the street and so convenient once you get used to how it works! Not to mention a bunch of local restaurants right around the area, all within walk-in distance!",1.0

Chicago,"This airbnb is in a central location right by a bunch of stores including Target, 7-11, a bank, and many other stores perfect for a traveler who likes to forget things. The parking that Nala had recommended was also only a short walkable distance away from the airbnb which made our packing and unpacking manageable.",1.0
Chicago,The apartment was as pictured in the ads and was exceptionally clean. It’s great location and featured conveniences made for a great stay in the city! I highly recommend this apartment for anyone looking to stay in Chicago.,1.0
Chicago,"Nala’s place was spectacular! It was within walking distance to our venue, the train, and other areas needed such as Target and Aldi’s. The apartment was private and quaint with all of the amenities you will need for a weekend getaway. As in the description, there was a bar below the apartment and we could hear the bass at night, but it wasn’t loud enough to keep us awake. Overall this is great place to stay for a Chicago visit!",1.0
Chicago,Great place to stay! Very comfortable and I have zero complaints. We were told that there would be small noise from the bar downstairs but with the white noise machine we didn’t hear a peep. Very glad we chose to stay here.,1.0
Chicago,"The unit was more than we expected. The apartment was clean and everything we needed was there. Nala was quick to respond to any questions and offer suggestions. The location was perfect, as it is near the El and I was able to easily find parking making our stay even more enjoyable. The unit itself is a pleasure to retire to after a day/night out in the city! Thank you Nala!",1.0
Chicago,"Nala’s place was great! It was exactly as advertised and the location was perfect, right next to the red line which made it really easy to use public transportation to go anywhere. I would definitely stay here again. The only problem was parking but we used Parquex and parked in a garage about 5 blocks away.",1.0
Chicago,"Nala’s place was very clean, cute, and the perfect location. It came with everything you needed down to shampoo/conditioner and soap in the gorgeous shower. It even included guest access to Netflix which was nice to turn on while getting ready for the day or winding down at night! We stayed for 3 nights and slept wonderfully! The white noise machine is great and we barely heard the bar downstairs! We took lyfts to several different attractions and they were all reasonably priced! It is in walking distance to a Target and Wrigley Field! Nala had suggested a parking app, parqex, to park our car while there and that was wonderful! $10 a day and a very easy walk from the flat. Checking in and out was so simple! Nala even had an associate, Joe, call to make sure we were all set to check in. I would highly recommend anyone looking for a place to stay in Chicago to check out Nala’s place!",1.0
Chicago,"Nala’s place was even nicer than expected. Super cute and very clean. It’s about the size of a bigger hotel room but with a small couch and kitchen area, it’s perfect for two people. We came to Chicago for a concert at the Aragon and this was the perfect location. Communication with Nala was great and check-in was easy. Would definitely stay here again.",1.0
Chicago,"We loved staying at Nala’s place. It’s in a cute neighborhood of Chicago, conveniently located next to the Train which allows easy access to downtown Chicago. The space is very clean and well-maintained. We would definitely consider staying here again.",1.0
Chicago,"This place is by far one of the nicest I've booked! From the location to the studio's style to the host's helpful tips, everything was amazing. And, something that's always super important to me, when I had a question, the host was quick to answer her phone and assist me. Which I greatly appreciated! Wonderful place.",1.0
Chicago,Experience was as described by Nala and other reviewers. Perfect clean little place to hang your hat. Yes the bar music below is a thing so plan for that. Otherwise location was excellent for us. Check-in and out was a breeze. Plan your parking before you arrive. Not sure why other reviewers call it a sketchy area. It seemed pretty standard for a residential area outside a big city. Nice coffee shop down the street called Heritage. Overall great hosts! K&D,1.0
Chicago,"The apartment was clean and easy to access. It was perfect for catching a show at the Aragon Ballroom, just a few blocks away.  Plenty of nearby shops and restaurants and cost about $13 to Uber DT. We found public parking in the Weiss Memorial Hospital parking ramp and were able to leave our car there for up to 72 hours. The sounds from the street and bar below are easily drowned out by the white noise speaker the hosts made available. This was a great place to stay!",1.0
Chicago,"Beautiful space. Incredibly clean, with friendly and accommodating hosts. Walkable to great dining, bars,  and entertainment, and easy to find free street parking nearby. We loved our stay here, and highly recommend it!",1.0
Chicago,"Nala’s place was so clean and well decorated, we instantly felt comfortable and at home. My boyfriend had to do some work when we first arrived and there was even a small desk for him to do his work at while I got ready for the day. For being a smaller studio the place has everything you need and then more. Nala was attentive and communicative and you could tell she cared about your stay in Chicago. I will mention is was very noisy as the apartment is directly above a bar that plays music about 4 in the morning. She does have a white noise machine to help drown the music but it’s still audible so if your a light sleeper like me beware.",1.0
Chicago,"Great location to the Red Line! This is a trendy flat, super clean and the host is very helpful with clear directions on how to access the apartment, as well as giving tips on local restaurants and attractions. The kitchen/fridge was great because we were staying for three nights.",1.0
Chicago,"What a place! So close to the Wilson Red/Brown/Purple like stop, and do private and quiet!   The space is like a luxury hotel room, with everything you need and more. I was traveling for business, so having an iron with ironing board was a huge plus. There’s also a kitchenette, washer/dryer (one machine that does both? We live in the future!), bathroom with big shower, and a comfy bed with lots of pillows.   Nala communicates so well, and does a great job helping you to be ready to check in and enjoy your stay. She recommended some local options for dining and entertainment, and answered my questions when I had them.   I will be back!",1.0
Chicago,Wonderful little place for a couple or one person to get away. The location was great for experiencing a lot of what Chicago has to offer outside the downtown area. The apartment was very clean and the bed was so comfortable. Will definitely use this spot again!,1.0
Chicago,"This little studio is just the right size for two people. The apartment was stylish, clean, and well-equipped. We were a bit worried about the noise from the bar downstairs, but it was barely audible. Plus, they provided a white noise machine just in case. Other reviewers have claimed that the neighborhood is kind of sketchy but this is absolutely not true. The location is perfect  if you are spending time on the north side and not too far away from the loop either. We recommend Heritage Outpost on Wilson or Lawrence if you're looking for espresso nearby (they have donuts on weekends) and if you're not into deep dish, Gigio's Pizza is a great NY-style pizza spot just around the corner on Broadway. ",1.0
Chicago,"Nala was awesome with communication and was very thoughtful when it came to ensuring we enjoyed our stay.  Nala recommended local dining, made sure we knew how to access the building, and made herself available for any questions.  The bed was comfy and the apartment was very clean.   Although my husband and I were only able to enjoy one night, we will definitely try to visit this space again.   ",1.0
Chicago,"Nala's place is (Website hidden by Airbnb) made me want to re-do my apartment! The decor is very Scandinavian-Bohemian. The overall space is bigger than it seems in the pictures, and was a perfect place for my boyfriend and I to comfortably crash for a night on a layover in Chicago. Nala offered great suggestions for things to do in Uptown, and we  had a wonderful experience. Having the el so close by was amazing and made everything in the city easy to access. And the air conditioner was a godsend since it was a hot summer night! I would absolutely stay here again! ",1.0
Chicago,"Very clean! Travel to downtown is about 15 mins (the drive down Lake Shore was worth it!). Expect to spend around $8-$15 per Uber trip. Apartment was not in the most ideal area.. it was a bit rough. The men at the fire station next door told us not to walk anywhere and be sure to get around using Uber, as it was not safe. The parking is a bit of a doozy as well... definitely recommend just biting the bullet and paying at the lot nearby using the Parqex! The apartment was very cozy and stylish. Nala and Julia were very sweet hosts and were sure to be of help in any way they could! Check in was easy with their detailed instructions. Thank you for the stay!",1.0
Chicago,"Thank you very much Nala! Your place was adorable and fit my cousin and I quite well! We will definitely love to stay here again if we come back. It was central to everything we wanted to do, especially Wrigley Field! ",1.0
Chicago,"Stylish, clean studio. Stayed there one night. Easy check in. You can park 5 minutes walking distance away for $11/night in an lot. Studio has everything you need and is very modern. Only downside is the neighborhood isn’t the best but it’s very close to all parts of the city and there is an L line a block away.",1.0
Chicago,Customer service was the BEST I’ve ever experienced. Nala checked in with me both at the midpoint and conclusion of my trip to make sure everything was suiting my needs during my stay. Very thoughtful and considerate- would highly recommend and would stay there again upon visiting Chicago.,1.0
Chicago,Great little spot in a good location! Right next to the local Red line which can take you downtown very easily! Also a little walk to Wrigleyville which was very fun to bar hop at night! Great host who always responded very quickly! cute little apartment perfect for a trip to Chicago! Highly recommended!,1.0
Chicago,"Nala's place is as good as a 5 star hotel (if not better) for a fraction of the price. Very pristine and clean, super stylish, easy check-in, and convenient locale. Just a few blocks away from the beach and an easy drive from the main attractions in the city. The bed is unbelievably comfortable and the shower is fantastic. Definitely willing to stay here again if ever I'm back in the windy city! ",1.0
Chicago,"I stayed for just one night as business traveler and was very impressed by the beauty of this cute apartment. The check in is easy and convenient 24/7 via a lockbox outside. I found the apartment to be extremely clean, well designed, all furniture and amenities completely new. The interior design and decoration is very beautiful, probably the nicest I have seen so far using AirBnB. Raindance shower! Thank you so much for hosting me!",1.0
Chicago,"Easy self check-in/out, beautiful place with many amenities, affordable and good location (a minute walk to the metro, typically $12-$15 lyft ride to/from downtown, $30 to/from O'Hare airport). The only problem I had was with the keyless access to get into the building. It was sometimes difficult to read so it took several tries before I could actually open the door. Nonetheless, this was a very minor problem and wasn't a big deal at all (just took a few tries). Overall, Nala's place was the perfect choice for my 4-night stay. It's most important for me to feel safe and comfortable wherever I am; Nala's place was just that.",1.0
Chicago,"We had a great stay at Nala and Owen’s. Very close to the red line which will take you almost anywhere you need to go in the city. Walking distance to restaurants and grocery stores made it very convenient. You could hear the bar below (as mentioned) but we brought ear plugs so it wasn’t an issue. The area can feel a bit dodgy after dark, but we got used to it after a day or so. The flat was super clean and very stylish. Perfect for a couples getaway. Would stay there again!",1.0
Chicago,"We had a really nice stay. The bed was really comfortable. Place is as described, very clean, cute and smells good. Communication with the host was fast and easy. The red line is super close, so it’s easy to get downtown.   Will definitely re-brook the same place if I comeback in Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"Nala’s place is stylish and cosy. Having a coffee machine and a washer/dryer was definitely a bonus. It was very clean and the bed was really comfortable, perfect for “Netflix and chill”! Just next to the subway, direct line to the Center which was good. The only downside was the music playing quite loud every night coming from the bar underneath... But we did enjoy our stay in Chicago. Thanks Nala for hosting us :)",1.0
Chicago,Nala’s place is great for staying just outside the city. Green Mill is a must for sublime live Jazz. She provided excellent tips about the area. Train station is close by allowing you to explore easily. Thank you! We loved Chicago.,1.0
Chicago,"Beautiful interior of the property which made it feel very homely. Amazing location, just next to the Wilson station and right next to a 7/11. Property felt very safe and secure.

Most importantly, the property was very clean. Thank you for being excellent hosts.",1.0
Chicago,"I agree with the reviews regarding the Bar. The aircon was my ""noise canceler""  The hospitality is 5 stars and its hassle free thanks to the self check in. The coffee machine is a plus and all amenities are brand new which is rare for Airbnb including great bedding and pillows. The neighborhood is a minus.",1.0

I would absolutely stay here again and recommend this Airbnb.",1.0
Chicago,"We had a lovely stay here and would come back in a heartbeat! Scott was so welcoming and responsive, and very thoughtful about making sure that we had everything we needed.

A perfect launchpad for exploring Chicago, or for taking some time to rest and relax.",1.0

Chicago,"I absolutely love the coach house. I spent about a week there my first week living in Chicago before my sublet became available. It was wonderful to have the comforts of the coach house to come home to as I transitioned to living in a new city.  It's clean, comfortable, private, spacious, and full of thoughtful touches - the fridge was stocked with bread, eggs, juice, and milk! Scott is an excellent and communicative host, providing everything you need and more.",1.0

I really appreciated the breakfast items that Scott stocked in the fridge (juice, coffee, 1/2 & 1/2, bread, butter), and all the thoughtful touches that made the place so comfortable.  The apartment is very nicely renovated, with an extremely comfortable bed and nice bathroom.

Scott's place is one of my favorite experiences I've ever had with Airbnb--thanks again for a wonderful stay!",1.0

Chicago,"This is a great Airbnb for anyone visiting Chicago. The coach house lives up to its name and is quite cozy. It's affordable, spacious and fully stocked. And I mean fully stocked. Food in the fridge, all the dishes you could need in the kitchen, books and entertainment to be enjoyed, toiletries and household products galore, and friendly and helpful conversation and answers to any questions you have from the host. Street parking was limited to one-side only during my stay, but I was still able to find parking nearby. It's in a great neighborhood and I felt safe walking around.   There's so much to do in Chicago, but if anyone is looking for suggestions, I recommend the nearby Andersonville shopping district, the Chicago Riverwalk, SNL The Experience at Museum of Broadcast Communications and the Airbnb experience called Get Exclusive Access to High Views! Some of my favorite eateries included Alexander's (breakfast), Yolk (brunch), Rice Thai (dinner), Calo Ristorante (dinner), Coffee Studio (coffee/snacks) and George's Ice Cream and Sweets (desserts).  Thanks for a great time, Scott. I definitely enjoyed my stay and will return. There's so much I didn't get a chance to check out, but want to.",1.0

And say hello to their friendly dog Bonnie!",1.0
Chicago,"Scott and Jill are wonderful hosts who worked extremely responsively with us as our scheduled arrival changed. They helped us figure out some of the neighborhoods we were looking for an apartment, gave us some tips on cool places to eat, and introduced us to their sweet doggo, Bonnie.  Their garage loft is a lovely, very clean space in a very quiet neighborhood. You walk through their beautiful garden and backyard, through their garage, and up into the spacious, well-lit space. There’s a full sized bathroom (bigger than most hotel rooms), decked out kitchen, and comfy sitting nook.  Great for couples and families, or just the solo traveler that needs some quiet space!",1.0

A great little coffee shop is within walking distance as are other businesses.    Scott's place is very private and secure.   There is a stairway that needs to be carefully navigated, but the upstairs loft is worth the climb.   Scott was very gracious and considerate of our needs.  We definitely will stay with Scott again!",1.0

Very cute neighborhood overall. ,1.0
Chicago,"This stay was great! The place was super clean and Scott was awesome with showing us where everything is and being right there if we needed the help! Definitely worth the stay.

Chicago,"We stayed for 2 nights for Loyola graduation, which is a 20 minute walk from the property.    The full apartment sits above Scott's shop/garage in a coach house separate from the main house.  The coach house is as described and Scott is a genial host.  I was pleasantly surprised by the details Scott had taken care of: the fridge was stocked with cream and other sundries, there was an A/C unit, and there were dishes and even a corkscrew.    I highly recommend it as a comfortable place to lay your head while spending your days taking in Chicago.",1.0

It is a great place to stay.  Fun neighborhood away from downtown but still very close to all the sights and events. Best restaurants in the area.  Would definitely stay there again!",1.0
Chicago,This was a great option for us in the Logan square area. Check in was a breeze. The place was tidy and clean. The stairs are quite steep so keep that in mind and travel light because it can be a tight squeeze from the alley where you park up the stairs. This may be an issue for little kids or elderly folks. The seating/TV was great and we enjoyed catching the games in the evening. Food recommendations were given to nearby restaurants. The beds were comfy and sheets felt high quality. I appreciated the king bed although I had to crawl into it since there was not space on the sides. One morning at 7:15 am we were awoken by maintenance (drilling/hammering) on the apartment. Not sure that’s anything they could prevent.,1.0

Their place was clean and had all the dish ware necessary for us to eat our take out. It was great that they had a dishwasher for dirty dishes. It saves time when getting the place ready for check out.   They even let us store our luggage after our stay so we could spend the day at the Chicago Art Institute. Would recommend.,1.0

I'd recommend this to anyone who is trying to stay in chicago not too far from downtown! It's was sparkling clean and I loved the decor. Hit them up! :),1.0
Chicago,It's a great space! I didn't realize it was about two blocks from the 606 paved trail which was great for walking/running. The space is very comfortable & stylish - we had everything we needed. If you are considering staying with energic kids you might want to talk to the hosts as we stayed with young kids (ages 4 & 2) and the lower neighbor complained about how loud they were. Other than that I would highly recommend!,1.0
Chicago,"This home is exceptionally clean, perfectly sized, and extremely comfortable. Would highly recommend. Check in was a breeze and Leo and Alex were very responsive and helpful. Great stay no complaints at all!",1.0
Chicago,"We had a wonderful stay for 4 days through the Christmas Holiday. It was close to family for us. So location worked well. A fabulous market with lots of fresh produce and an actual meat market was around the corner. Also their is a cool neighborhood coffee place.

Towels galore & amazing location where we felt safe, close to everything we needed and a few short miles to the heart of Chicago. And such kind people, that care about every little detail in their home. Btw the kitchen is HUGE & gorgeous so we enjoyed cooking! And even had laundry downstairs. Can’t say enough good things about this place! A must stay and definitely coming back to Leo & Alex’s home away from home! Thank you for having us!!!",1.0

When we come back to Chicago we’ll definitely be staying here again! Thanks for everything, Leo & Alex! ",1.0
Chicago,"Great spot!  Two bedrooms, a living room, and a large kitchen on  second floor walk up.  The included parking spot was invaluable.  Walking distance to some very cool spots in Rogers Park (and Wicker Park, kind of a long walk though).  Very clean!  It was a great place to stay.  If they’re available next time I visit chicago, I’ll definitely stay again.",1.0

Chicago,"We really enjoyed the apartment, and how Leo & Alex sent us a list of recommendations within walking distance. The pictures are accurate, there were plenty of towels, and check in was seamless. We also liked how we could log into our Netflix account on the TV, so after a long day of sightseeing, we decided to have a beer on the couch instead of going out. Perfect.",1.0
Chicago,"All check-in directions were spot on and very easy to follow. It was very hassle free. The place is just as pictured and very comfortable. Very comfy beds and extra large couch.   Leo & Alex provided very good local suggestions. Best Intentions and Ground Control  were fast favorites. Walgreens, grocery store and A very good coffee shop are all well within walking distance.   Logan Square had tons of great things to do and grabbing a Lyft to downtown was easy and pretty inexpensive.   We really enjoyed staying here and would recommend it and would like to come back sometime.",1.0
Chicago,"Alex and Leo’s apartment was as described. Clean, updated and hip! Fresh linens and towels. The parking space in the back is a great bonus as you need a permit to park on the street to avoid being ticketed. Communication was also prompt and helpful!",1.0
Chicago,"Great space, it was very clean, and a nice quiet side of town. We went to Damn fine coffee every morning, it was about a 2 minute walk, great coffee! Our bed was super comfortable too. We would recommend this gem to anyone. ",1.0
Chicago,"The place was great! Clean, comfortable and easy in and out. Parking was great! Smart & interesting decor. Comfy large couch. Large kitchen with plenty of room. We had friends from out of State visiting and the place worked out great as the bedrooms are on opposite sides of the apartment. Recommend!",1.0
Chicago,"Leo & Alex's place is so charming! It's nicely decorated, had wi-fi and some cable, and has a super comfortable couch. The beds are AMAZING; it was like sleeping on clouds. (Also, the lighting makes for amazing selfies, if you are into that!) The only problem we had was finding the parking lot. It's off an alley that isn't quite directly behind the house. We were able to find it eventually though. Honestly I will probably stay here again when I visit Chicago next. ",1.0
Chicago,"We had a great time at Leo & Alex's place, it was very central to everything we had planned in Chicago. They were great with check in instructions and provided us a great list of local things to do. Would definitely stay here again in the future! Thank you!",1.0

Chicago,"We greatly appreciate Leo & Alex for sharing their beautiful apartment with us during our stay in Chicago.  We spent the majority of our time downtown Chicago, but loved leaving the craziness of the city behind each evening to stay in this stylish, quiet, and comfy apartment. We would definitely stay here again when visiting Chicago. ",1.0
Chicago,Great place and location.  Has everything one would need for a home away from home.  Did not have the pleasure of meeting the hosts in person but they were attentive when needed.  Check-in was hassle free and having a personal parking spot (as we had a rental car) was an added bonus.  Would definitely look to stay here again should our travels bring us back to Chicago.  Thanks Leo & Alex for a great stay!,1.0
Chicago,"This location is fantastic. With Uber, getting around was especially easy. The free parking space was awesome too.   Check in was easy, the space was sleek and comfortable. The neighborhood was great with a bakery, coffee shop and bar/ restaurant nearby. Highly recommended!",1.0
Chicago,Our family enjoyed the space. The check-in process was easy. The photos and description are accurate. The house was very clean. It’s very nice that it has a private parking space. The parking is at the back and there is a narrow pathway next to the house where you can walk from  the parking lot to the front door.    This can be a bit inconvenient if you are carrying many luggage. We love the kitchen and dinning area where we cooked breakfast and heated up leftovers. The only thing is the air condition was quite loud. But we don’t get too much noise in the bedrooms.,1.0
Chicago,"This apartment is very hip and stylish with nice added amenities such as a parking space and location to store luggage before and after check-in. We had a great stay here although in the future will most likely stay somewhere downtown. This place is a great value and very affordable but we spent more on uber rides than what we would have to spend more on a place downtown. But that is no fault of Leo and Alex! Logan Square is very nice, safe and clean and there are a lot of local places to eat. Many are vegan and/or overpriced which wasn't necessarily for us but we did have an amazing meal at Giant which is a 3-4 minute walk from this AirBnB. It was on the pricier side but soooo worth it! A great dinner spot for us to celebrate our anniversary! I would highly recommend Leo and Alex's place!",1.0
Chicago,"Leo & Alex's place was great and the included parking space was much appreciated. The house was clean, check in was easy, and the surrounding neighbourhood was great. Highly recommend staying here and will book again for future Chicago trips!",1.0
Chicago,"Lovely, sun filled apartment with very comfy beds. It was a great place to have a bit of a retreat off the beaten path in Logan Square area. It's better for a person who is driving as it came with a parking space. If you will mostly be walking you may want to pick a spot a bit closer to the train, but the bike share is very close and I enjoyed strolling the neighborhood and finding local hangouts. The kitchen was well appointed and there's coffee and seasonings available as well. Thanks for a great and affordable stay.",1.0
Chicago,Leo and Alex's place was everything I dreamed of. Tidy and clean but also with an incredible aesthetic. They have such an incredible attention to detail on what their guests would need to be comfortable. I highly recommend booking this spot if you can!,1.0
Chicago,"Leo and Alex's place was close to many food places and the living space was modern. The beds were comfortable and the kitchen was spacious. The only down side are the stairs when you are walking up them with luggage- but the posting makes note of this which we appreciate. In addition, I always love and appreciate it when hosts allow you to store your luggage securely prior the check in. Overall a pleasant experience.",1.0
Chicago,"A cute, stylish apartment, with a wonderful throne-type chair and comfy sectional couch to relax on.  Beautiful kitchen with a full-service fridge, gas stove, and dishwasher, fully stocked with pots and pans for cooking.  It was the perfect size for our family of four (kids 6 & 9), very quiet and comfy, and within walking distance of some great brunch places.  I had some questions the morning after we arrived and they responded by text and phone call within minutes.  Overall a great experience- thanks!",1.0
Chicago,"The apartment was lovely and the beds were very comfortable. I was traveling with 3 younger girls (12, 11, and 11) and I loved that the location was near plenty of coffee shops, restaurants, and parks. The area is definitely a mix of lower to mid income residents and students. With plenty of funky, high end, hipster spots. We felt very safe walking the neighborhood. And we had plenty of room in the space to spread out! The biggest plus was the free parking. Leo and Alex were gracious enough to allow us to use the lot a bit early, before check in, and a bit later, after check out. All things were accessible by Uber in 5 minutes or so. ~20 Uber ride to downtown. I would definitely give this spot another visit and recommend it to others.",1.0
Chicago,"This is a perfectly sweet little house, and we loved staying here! Super clean and with a bus stop just around the corner- So convienent. Once we parked in their back lot, we never had to drive again during our trip which was so nice.  We would 100% stay at Leo & Alex’s next time we’re in Chicago. Thank you for such an amazing first air bnb experience!",1.0

Chicago,My husband and I stayed here while meeting friends in Chicago. This is a super quiet neighborhood that's about a 15 minute walk from the blue line. The space itself was very comfortable and very quiet and clean. Had everything we could have needed and more. Would definitely stay again and highly recommend.,1.0
Chicago,"HIGHLY RECOMMEND. I walked into a chic, modern, clean apartment with wood floors. The couch was comfy. The rain shower head was amazing. Plenty of hot water. The beds were pretty comfy. The location was 5 mins down the road from Logan square and about 15 mins from downtown for more touristy attractions. The host was very responsive to all questions. The street is a little crowded but you can find a spot there as well as the spot provided in the lot behind the unit, which is great for Chicago where you usually have a hard time trying to find parking, this was not the case at all here. Overall a very pleasent, peaceful stay at a hip place. Will be coming again in my future visits!",1.0
Chicago,"All the five star reviews are right on. This place is exactly as advertised: quiet, clean, comfortable, and in a great location. If we ever find ourselves in Chicago again we will absolutely be checking to see if this apartment is available!",1.0

Chicago,"Holy cow. This place is amazing. We spent most of our time around the Logan Square neighborhood, and Leo and Alex’s pad is no more than ~5 minutes drive from Chicago Diner. (Best restaurant in town.) The home itself is so spacious and inviting, and I can’t recommend it enough. Also, the bed might have been one of the most comfortable ones we’ve ever experienced. Can’t wait to go back!",1.0
Chicago,"This space was perfect! With ample room in a quiet neighborhood, we adored the decor inside: modern yet home-y. I live about an hour away but wanted to stay closer to the city for birthday plans and this was a great spot to be away but close enough! It truly felt like a little get away and will be highly considering this place if I need a spot to stay again for a quick trip. Having a spot for free parking was icing on the cake!",1.0
Chicago,We had a great stay here. I used to live in the area and loved the location of this apartment. Best Intentions being right around the block was a huge plus. Space was beautiful and clean with a large comfy bed.,1.0
Chicago,"Came into Chicago during the worst of the snow storm this year, and Leo & Alex's home was everything we could ask for and more! Lizbeth, who manages the rental responded to all of my texts immediately and was very attentive to our needs. Location/neighborhood is superb as we were within 10-15 mins drive of trendy restaurants and bars.. Home space was very trendy and cozy, which was great for hanging out when the storm was heavy, and beds were probably the most comfortable I've slept on in all of my stays on Airbnb. I would absolutely love to stay here again whenever back in Chicago.  Just note that if the snow is ever really bad during your stay, that it can be a bit difficult to get in/out of the parking area.. Factor in extra time to dig out and defrost your car and driveway, which from a Californian, wasn't as bad it seemed...",1.0
Chicago,"The hosts were very quick to respond, the place was super clean and modern.

Great overall location, close to the United Center, Bucktown, Wicker Park, or even downtown.    Thanks again for an awesome experience!",1.0
Chicago,"They responded promptly, answered my call when I had a question, the air bnb is clean and cute and the beds are super comfy.

It's got all the things you need and... quite a bit more. ",1.0
Chicago,We had a great stay at Leo and Alex’s place! It was clean and in a quiet neighborhood. Parking was easy with the instructions.

Chicago,"Thank you for hosting my son and me in your home! The location was absolutely perfect. We were able to take the 10-min walk to the L every morning and enjoy the gorgeous neighborhood! Lula Cafe was our favorite dining experience of the trip and it was just an 8-minute wall from this Airbnb. This was my first time booking a room in someone’s home, but all of my concerns were completely alleviated. I was worried we might bother you, but we never even crossed paths! Thanks again for having us. We couldn’t have been happier with our stay!",1.0

We felt safe in the neighborhood and it was convenient to be able to come and go as needed without feeling like we were disturbing them, and they are very quiet in the morning! Thanks again for a great stay!!",1.0
Chicago,"BEST PLACE IN LOGAN SQUARE-You won't find a more friendly host, a 10 minute walk to the L, a beautiful park just a few minutes away, close to Tom's grocery store, and just an overall wonderful living experience.

A big plus for me was the private washroom which was not only sparkling clean and extremely spacious but also full of all amenities one would need. And ofcourse, how can I not mention about the cutest, warmest cat I've ever met and that's Sir Dumpling!

There was no restriction for in and out timings. They gave me a separate key for that. There were nice restaurants near to their place to eat. I also found several Indian restaurants to eat. Try Chicago deep dish pizza from Big tonys (Small one is more than sufficient for 2 people). There is a small store near to there house called VISHNU FOOD INC(run by an Indian guy).

Chicago,"We had a perfect weekend getaway in Chicago thanks to the great location, amenities and city views of Jing's apartment. We didn't need a car! Everywhere we wanted to go was either walkable or accessible via a short walk to the L train.

A great spot to land after an adventurous day in the city.",1.0

We had easy Uber rides to all of our destinations. Jing was so easy to communicate with. We did not use the kitchen but it appeared well stocked.",1.0
Chicago,"I chose Jing’s place because of how close it was to the Chicago Marathon course. When I arrived, the front desk was very thorough in making sure I was who I said I was so I immediately felt very safe. Some other residents in the building were very kind and helped me with the elevator (which was different from anything I’ve seen before). Once I walked into the apartment, I said “Wow” because the view was amazing. I arrived very late and could see far stretches of city lights. Everything was very clean and the layout was well thought out. I was able to quickly make coffee in the morning and there were bags of goldfish, perfect for a snack after a late flight. Absolutely worth the price and I would stay again!",1.0
Chicago,Great location! Very clean and bright. We were allowed to drop off our bags before check in which we really appreciated b cause e arrived in the city before check in. We dropped. Gas and off we went to explore. He was very friendly and accommodating.,1.0

I 100% recommend this apartment and it's great host!,1.0
Chicago,"Nice apartment with great views and new clean space. Everything laid out for me like a fancy hotel: fresh towels, fresh sheets, cups out, snacks out, individual soaps. Comparable cost to nearby hotels, and much less expensive than hotels during busy convention days when the city hotels get booked up! I passed by (but didn’t get to use) a pool & a coffee/pastry shop on first floor. Highly recommend!",1.0
Chicago,"This apartment is located on 46th floor. Only 15 mins walk to downtown. Close to food hall, Whole Foods and CVS. Coffee shop downstairs.

Chicago,"It is a great and very comfortable apartment, with a lot of wardrobes. Two comfortable beds, good kitchen, nice view to the south from the 46th floor. The surrounding is very clean and safe. It is a 10 minute walk to a Whole Foods Market and to the Mariano´s Supermarket (we prefered Mariano´s).  Clinton cta Station is also 10 minutes walk away. There you can take the green or pink line to the loop. We really enjoyed our stay and can extremly recommend this apartment. We would stay there at next time. Jing is always helpful if you have any questions, thanks a lot.  Hier meine Anmerkungen in Deutsch (German): Wir haben den Aufenthalt in Chicago sehr genossen. Das Apartment war sehr komfortabel, vor allem die beiden Betten, von denen man einen tollen Blick auf Chicago hat (leider nicht auf den Lake Michigan. Unser Apartment war im 46 sten Stock, also wirklich ein schöner Blick. Es gibt sehr große zum Teil begehbare Kleiderschränke. Die Lage ist super, in einer ruhigen und sicheren Umgebung. Zum Whole Foods Supermarkt und zum Mariano´s, den wir empfehlen, sind es nur ca. 10 Minuten Fußweg.  7 Eleven, Starbucks und ein paar Restaurants sind in der Nähe des Apartments. Zur cta Bahn Station Clinton sind es ebenfalls 10 Minuten. Von dort fahren die pink und die green Line, 2 Stationen und man ist im Loop (State & Lake), von dort kommt man überall hin. Wir können das Apartment auf jeden Fall empfehlen und würden es beim nächsten Mal wieder buchen.",1.0
Chicago,"Michael’s place is amazing!!! My boyfriend and I stayed here for the 4th of July and had a wonderful time in his artistic space. Where do I begin on the details? Everything was perfect from the huge Brazilian shower, to the flower rooftop garden, to the soft king bed, to the random artistic pieces, and to the laid back vibes of his place. Micheal was a great host, very communicative and super accommodating. His son had a 4th of July party on the rooftop and invited us and the other Airbnb guests to join (there is another bedroom in the back of the studio, but it has its own bathroom). It was great meeting new friends and having a space that was shared by others. Although it was a loft, and thus noisy/not quite as private at times, the curtains wrap all the way around and do a good job of closing the bedroom off from view of others. The space is also in prime real estate with tons of bars and restaurants below.",1.0
Chicago,"You do not want to miss Michael’s spot! Seriously such a perfect location; right as you walk outside you’re in the heart of River North.

Chicago,"This is a very unique space and unique host. The apartment has a lot of charm to it, one of a kind fixtures, and the rooftop is excellent. The location is so close to everything downtown, with the only small issue being some noise from the local bars during the weekend (ear plugs are provided). That being said, we slept great and without issue all the nights we were there. We also had great neighbors during the trip, and enjoyed breakfast with them on the roof every morning. I highly recommend this space.",1.0

Chicago,The place is super artsy and picture perfect.  You can literally take great pictures inside of this place.

Chicago,Michael is very friendly and a great host. He was very accommodating and flexible to our schedule. The location is great. We were able to go to all the key places in downtown Chicago by foot.

I will definitely stay with Michael next time I am in the city!",1.0
Chicago,"Amazing stay!!! Loved it so much, I'm already trying to figure out when I can return. Michael is so nice and interesting, we had many great conversations. The other guests were lovely. There is a nightclub in the building and it does get loud on Fri and Sat nights. I'm a light sleeper so it was a tad challenging for me but I'm still returning and so glad i stayed there! It's so creative and full of inspiration!!! Highly recommend! Also central to everything! I walked everywhere ",1.0

We can’t wait to come back during the summer and hang out on his rooftop garden! Michael is a fantastic host and makes sure that you have everything you need. Definitely recommend his place!,1.0
Chicago,"I absolutely loved Michael's place. Truly a working artist's loft.  Creative use of space was fascinating, and the rooftop deck was incredible.  Michael was a great host - I enjoyed hearing the story of the loft and his time there.",1.0
Chicago,"Everything Michael says is true. Read his notes. Great place wonderful style close to everything. Also night life and 5 floor walk up. But don’t let that deter you. Michael is a consummate host, a traveler himself that appreciates other travelers. A wonderful stay. And art.",1.0
Chicago,"Michael provided the best experience I’ve had with Airbnb. Some of the highlights:  *great location. 5 minutes walking distance from the House of Blues, 15-20 to Michigan Avenue, and 20-25 to Millennium Park.   *clean, comfortable, and unique with a view. The bed is super comfortable, the bathroom is large and clean, and the apartment is filled with all sorts of treasures that Michael is more than willing to share the story behind.  *Michael himself is great. He’s kind and makes sure you have everything you need. I was waiting in line for a couple hours in the snow for a concert, and he gave my friend a blanket and sports chair to bring to me so that I would be comfortable. In the mornings, he made us espresso and we had a great time talking about Chicago, his art, and the best places to go thrifting.   This is one Airbnb that I will stay at again. I hope to come back in the summer when all the flowers on his porch are blooming!  Two things to note (though not necessarily negative):  *you have to walk up 5 flights of stairs to get to the apartment.  *it’s a lively street at night, so bring earplugs if you’re a light sleeper.",1.0
Chicago,"Our stay at Michael’s place was fantastic.  The location was close to everything, shopping, theater district, the L. The loft itself was so unique and we felt at home. The bed is extremely comfortable. The night life is loud on Friday and Saturday so I wouldn’t recommend for light sleepers. We Were exhausted and had no trouble sleeping. You also have to walk up 5 floors so if you’re not keen on stairs, I wouldn’t recommend. We personally liked the exercise and it was well worth it. Will definitely stay again next time we’re in Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"Michael's loft is an absolutely beautiful apartment in a central location. Check-in was easy and flexible, and the apartment was cozy and comfortable.   Michael is a great host and shared tips on seeing the city.  The stairs up to the loft are no joke -- don't book this if you aren't comfortable walking up five flights! I also stayed on a Saturday night and while he does mention that it can be noisy, it was louder than I expected it to be. Do bring ear plugs and maybe consider a different listing if you are a light sleeper and staying on the weekend.   I'd definitely come back and stay at Michael's again next time I'm in Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"I absolutely loved staying at Michaels-- will absolutely stay again if I'm in Chicago. One of the most personable hosts I've encountered, the place was phenomenal and there were so many small touches he added. There's a huge rooftop space, unbeatable location, easy check-in/out, timely responses. Large bathroom/shower (for the loft I stayed in). Book it you won't regret it!",1.0
Chicago,"Our stay at Michael’s was incredible! We had high expectations for the unique artist loft and location and everything was surpassed. The space is amazing—we loved our loft and the views from the apartment. Michael is so creative, hospitable, and a natural host. Everything we needed was provided and made for a very comfortable stay. He kindly offered for us to use his washer/dryer in unit, hold our bags after checkout until we headed out of the city, and of course gave us many recommendations and fun Chicago facts. Thank you, Michael! We can’t wait to return.",1.0
Chicago,"This is exactly what we needed and Michael is great. Unique loft in a very central location of Chicago, very nice and recently refurbished bathroom. Michael left us water with lemon when we arrived and even espresso and juice in the morning! Highly recommend.",1.0
Chicago,"From booking to check out, Michael was extremely accommodating and thorough. I love to stay in unique spaces and Michael’s space was perfect. The city centric location, proximity to a variety of bars, restaurants, stores and venues was ideal. Michael was a great host with a lot of knowledge and unique insight to his city and recommendations during our short stay. The room was delightfully comfortable we almost missed walking around the city! :) I would not hesitate staying here again especially to see the outdoor patio all planted. This truly felt like a home away from home.",1.0
Chicago,"Michael’s place is so cute and full of character and art. It is minutes away in walking from restaurants, small bites, and late night spots. We stayed on a Tuesday and around 3:30/4am, it did get a little noisy outside. I woke up for the restroom and I could not fall back asleep for about 30 min. The bars close around that time and there were some loud conversations/ (from what it sounded like) drunken arguments. So I did get a little worried, but I eventually fell back asleep and everything was fine. It is the city so it’s something to expect. Also, I don’t believe that I would have been woken up by the noise if I had not already been up. There is access to a full kitchen and more than one living room/ seating area! Glad I got to stay because it was SO convenient and I will most likely stay again.  P.S. cheap parking using the app Michael shares is like 3 min walking distance away.",1.0
Chicago,"Staying at Michael's artist loft was a great experience. Amazing location for the price, we were in walking distance of everything we needed. The art and aesthetic of the loft was very fun and we will absolutely return someday.",1.0

Chicago,"Michael’s place is quite unique, as advertised. Definitely the coolest Airbnb I’ve had so far. The location is great, with lots of restaurants and bars right on the street, and a short walk to Millennium Park.",1.0
Chicago,I loved the whole thing. Such a good location and beautiful space. Even though I was sharing the space with another guest it was so safe and (Website hidden by Airbnb) a 5 floor walk up so differently abled folks should book elsewhere.,1.0
Chicago,This is an absolutely incredible space with an incredible owner! My flight arrived early and Michael allowed me to come in before my designated check in to drop my things off. The loft is spacious and perfectly cozy. The house has all of the necessary amenities and a beautifully updated bathroom. Would recommend 100% and will definitely want to stay again if I’m in the area.,1.0
Chicago,"We had a lovely, yet brief time staying with Michael on Hubbard. The loft area where we stayed was roomy and matched the pictures and description. The curtains gave us the needed privacy. Michael was a very kind host who took time to speak with us and was enthusiastic about sharing about his home and suggestions for the city. We had no problem coming and going and check in and check out were simple and hassle-free. The location cannot be beat. I would stay here again.",1.0
Chicago,Michael and his loft are both AMAZING! From the moment we walked in he showed us around his loft that was filled with beautiful art and plants. He has an outdoor deck that is great for getting pictures of the building around. Very close to night life and great food. He was very attentive in making sure we had everything we needed. We will be back! Thank you Michael for the great experience!,1.0
Chicago,"Michael's place is cool and urban and cozy!  Michael made us feel welcome and at home as soon as we met him.  Our room was immaculate and comfortable. We didn't mind walking up to the 5th floor, and we didn't mind the noise of the city night-life, but Michael let's you know all about his place before you decide to stay with him. We did enjoy the very unique and comfortable space, and the great location! Parking was inexpensive if you use the SpotHero app, which Michael suggested. Next time we stay with Michael, we will visit in nicer weather so we can spend time on the rooftop with the spectacular view!! Thanks again for a great visit to Chicago!",1.0
Chicago,"Michael was communicative, accomodating, and easy to get along with. He was happy to give us privacy but was still available when we had questions or needs during our stay. Although we only spent one night in Michael’s apartment, we found it very comfortable and relax. We really enjoyed our time here! Cool space, amazing rooftop views, and a nice, eccentric host.",1.0
Chicago,We loved the uniqueness of this home. So much charm! Mike was very helpful and quick to respond and accommodating. If you're looking for something super organized and spotless this might be a little disappointing. But I loved it and enjoyed the vibes and great location.,1.0
Chicago,"The place is busy at night, so it is not quiet. The music is playing, cars are honking, but i didnt have trouble sleeping. It is nice place on 5th floor, without elevator so you need to take all your luggage up by the stairs. The place got ""brazilian shower"". I am not an expert for showers but it was nice experience.",1.0
Chicago,"Michael's place was absolutely beautiful. The location is fantastic, and the apartment itself is completely fascinating. Michael was brilliant and super friendly, a great host. Next time we're in Chicago, we'll definitely be staying here!",1.0
Chicago,"Michael’s place is great - it’s very stylish and unique, located in a great location. I was there for a business trip and I could walk everywhere, I didn’t have to get an Uber once.  Michael is also very friendly and provided some excellent tips to help me get better acquainted with my surroundings. I’d definitely go there again if I come back to Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"Not much can be said that hasn’t already been said. The place is one-of-a-kind, Michael is a one-of-a-kind host - very helpful and accommodating. The location is perfect, walking distance to downtown, train stop to the airport, and many great restaurants.  The view from the patio is excellent, we will definitely return in the summer time!",1.0
Chicago,"My girlfriend and I stayed at Michael's place for a couple of days on our way back from Austin, Texas, to Stockholm, Sweden, and we could not have been more satisfied with our choice! The apartment is amazing and Michael was very friendly! Next time we come to Chicago we will for sure try to stay at Michael's place again!",1.0
Chicago,"My husband and I really enjoyed being Michael’s guests. His place is absolutely amazing, very clean, and has a great vibe to it. The location is awesome, the place is located in the walking distance from some great restaurants, and main Chicago attractions. Michael was very kind and attentive and provided us with everything we needed. We will definitely return to this place in summer to enjoy breakfasts on Michael’s beautiful terrace.",1.0
Chicago,"Michael’s place is in the perfect location if you want to explore Chicago. The loft is comfortable, spacious, and every amenity is provided. The place has a great vibe, and Michael is a terrific host - always helpful, ready with advice on where to explore or dine. This was my second time staying here, and I intend to be back in the near future. An excellent experience all around!",1.0
Chicago,"Michael was a fantastic and friendly host who really went out of his way to make sure we had the best time in Chicago. The loft was spacious and comfortable for three people. The magical deck, with his well maintained flowers, was a special way to wake up as well as see the city in the evening.   Can’t wait to get back and explore more of the amazing city that is Chicago!",1.0
Chicago,"We had a wonderful stay at Michael's home. The apartment is in a brilliant location, close to the heart of Chicago. The apartment is unique and enchanting with a magnificent rooftop garden that we enjoyed. Michael himself was very welcoming and a brilliant host! Michael is interesting and had a wealth of local knowledge that helped us experience some less known sights in Chicago. Overall we loved our stay in Chicago!",1.0
Chicago,We loved Michael's place and it was one of the more unique AirBNB's we have stayed at. The loft was warm and welcoming and the vibe of the apartment was eclectic. The location was perfect in the hip and trendy River North. Michael was great to chat with and he provided great ideas of things to do in the area. We highly recommend - Tonya and Jake.,1.0
Chicago,"We really enjoyed staying at Michael's place, and wish it could have lasted longer! The outside terrace and its 100+ flowers is stunning, even in the rain. The apartment is located in a very lively neighborhood, with lots of restaurants and bars around, and very easy to get around walking, or with an uber. Michael was also very helpful and welcoming, he even got up and made us coffee before our early morning flight!",1.0
Chicago,I booked two night at Michael’s place as a wedding present for my friends and they absolutely loved it. Michael made every effort to make it special for them and decorated it out with fresh flowers and was excellent at staying in contact with me to ensure they could find their way and enjoyed their stay. Fantastic hospitality! ,1.0
Chicago,"Michael's beautiful loft space has set the bar high, as this was our first Airbnb experience. It was such a unique space with access to an amazing rooftop patio filled with flowers. We shared some of the space with a wonderful couple that enhanced our experience. Michael was so warm and accommodating and he pays a lot of attention to detail ensuring his guests are comfortable as well as informed about the hot spots in the area. The area itself felt safe and all restaurants we went to in the area were delicious. I couldn't be happier with our stay!",1.0
Chicago,"Thank you so much, Michael for the wonderful accommodation and the talks on the beautiful deck. We loved (!!!!) the loft with its details! On our next Chicago visit, we are hoping that we can check in at your place again! See you and greetings from Germany.   People, go and book this appartment, it is worth every penny! ",1.0
Chicago,"Hosts don't get much more welcoming than Michael! He makes you feel right at home straight away. Upon arriving he immediately offered me a drink, we sat and chatted for a while and then he kindly left me to do my own thing. His place is really quirky. It might not be for everyone, but I loved it! Being a loft apartment, the bedroom isn't the most private but it was fine for me. Overall I'd say the apartment is perfect for people traveling on their own or in couples.  His flamboyant rooftop is certainly a highlight of the place, especially if the weather is good. One of the most memorable moments of my trip was sitting out on the rooftop with a very friendly couple who were also staying with Michael through airbnb. We sat out there until the early hours with a couple of beers and enjoyed a great conversation. Michael even came to join us for a while.  The location is fantastic. The apartment is very central and in one of the most popular parts of town. The down side to that is that the apartment building is right next to a night club, so if you're staying over the weekend you'll hear all the music through the wall as well as the people down on the street (Chicagoans love honking their horns at all hours of the day/night ?!). Michael offers some ear plugs though, so unless you're a light sleeper you should be okay.  All in all, I really enjoyed my stay and I'd happily return. Thanks, Michael!",1.0
Chicago,"What a amazing experience it was to meet Mike and stay in his home. His home is unbelievable. There really was no better way to spend an evening, than in his rooftop garden with a bottle of wine. This apartment really has it all in a prime location. Thanks again Mike and we will definitely be back.",1.0
Chicago,"Michael's loft is simply beautiful, clean and exactly as pictured. It is central and easy to walk to from the train. We found it easy to go around without needing to use the subway. Many tourist spots were just a 15-20 minute walk away and it was also close to the riverwalk. There are many good restaurants and bars near by, easily in a perfect location. Michael is a great and friendly host, I would definitely want to stay here again if I were to come back to Chicago. Thank you so much for sharing your loft with us and it was lovely to meet you!",1.0
Chicago,"Michael's place was absolutely amazing and is definitely one of the coolest Airbnbs that I've ever stayed in!!  He was very helpful with check-in and check-out times and had the best local recommendations.  The location of the apartment is perfection and  I would definitely recommend his place to anyone taking a trip to Chicago, it's a must stay!",1.0
Chicago,"We had a great 3 days with Michael in the loft. It was well worth the 5 flights of stairs. Michael and his apartment are both full of character, and the rooftop garden is a unique experience. As Michael says its a working artists studio and its full of interesting old collectibles and artwork , so don't expect it to be pristine. We had lots of interesting discussions with Michael and he gave us some good tips on local eateries etc , one of our more memorable AirBNB  stays , Cheers Michael, Highly recommended",1.0
Chicago,"The place is amazing, everything was the same as described and better.. it’s perfectly located, close to shops, restaurants and public transport. Micheal is a legend always keen for a laugh and making sure you feel comfortable..  I’m looking forward to come back again. I’d definitely recommend this place",1.0
Chicago,"Michael's loft is a trip in itself - if you're looking for a brilliant and unique experience, this is the place and Michael is your guy! Terrific location, and a great deck to enjoy. Michael will blow you away with his friendliness and hospitality. Keep in mind you are in the city and that comes with its nightlife - but that's all part of it! Thanks again Michael, you made a great Chicago experience.",1.0
Chicago,"Michael’s place is Great, so much to stare at. Fantastic location, Nice and busy street. The bed was really comfortable. Michael is charming and easy going and gave good tips for places to go. I loved sitting out on the rooftop after a Night out.",1.0
Chicago,"Michael's loft is unique and beautiful! He was extremely welcoming to us and our dog and took loving care of him while we went to places that weren't dog-friendly. The bed was very comfortable and HUGE, the rain shower head was a nice touch, and he offered us laundry services and excellent local food recommendations. It was a wonderful stay. Those 5 flights of stairs are no joke though, so don't forget anything in the loft when you leave for the day. The location is great. Starbucks and LYFE kitchen across the street as well as many great bars and restaurants. Saturday night the bars were bumpin' so if you're a light sleeper, beware. It didn't bother us though.",1.0
Chicago,The place was great and the neighborhood restaurants were amazing. I had the pleasure to meet Ken. He could not have been nicer and a wealth of knowledge. My wife and i loved  our stay. My brother and wife stayed with us o e night would strongly recommend this place as a place to stay. It felt like home,1.0
Chicago,Ken’s place was wonderful. The neighborhood was very easy to park and charming to walk around in. It inspired me to research the history of Little Italy. The beds were so comfortable. We had a professor from Thailand traveling with us and she was very impressed. It may get be the most beautiful AirBnb place we have stayed in.,1.0
Chicago,"Polk Street Coach House is a home away from home! Very clean, beautiful, roomy space. Easy check-in process, warm greetings, stocked with everything you could need (shampoo, conditioner, body wash, towels) and extra little touches (coffee, water, snacks) that were much appreciated in getting our day started during this weekend with family. Thank you so much! A++++",1.0
Chicago,"To all that are considering the Coach House: to quote the famous Nike ad campaign, “Just do it”! From the moment you walk in until the minute after you leave, you will realize this place is a gem and worth telling all you know about it.  The tender care that has been put in place is perfect. Do yourselves a favor, stay in Chicago’s Little Italy at the Coach House. You will feel well cared for and welcomed. Honestly, who would want more than that?",1.0
Chicago,"Comfy beds, stylish space, clearly marked directions to wifi, parking permits, etc.: all within walking distance to dinner or breakfast in Little Italy (charming area) and minutes away from the Bean, Museum of Art and Miracle Mile.    We didn't meet Ken, but Kurt made thoughtful recommendations to us (Stax has great pancakes & waffles & offers gluten free options).  Espresso pods, water and trail mix were welcome treats.  One thing to note:  the coach house is mostly upstairs (laundry downstairs).  Hosts do mention this, but the stairs are no joke, especially if you have heavy luggage.  Fantastic space & location & hosts.  Hope we have a reason to visit again soon!",1.0
Chicago,"Ken's place is perfectly located and very homey. We were just a couple of blocks from the Pink Line, which gave us easy access to downtown, and also a block from Little Italy that has a variety of restaurants. His place had all the amenities for a home away from home, including a washer/dryer, which was key for us traveling with a baby. Ken checked in with us to see if we needed anything and even brought over some wrenches to help us adjust our stroller. Highly recommend the Polk Street Coach House!",1.0
Chicago,"This is our second stay at the coach house and it was just a lovely as the first. Ken’s attention to detail (labeled light switches!) and added touches (coffee, snacks, bottles water and FREE PARKING) add to why this our favorite Airbnb in Chicago. It is conveniently located near two “L” lines, so you can easily get anywhere in the city you like. However, it is nice to be in a quiet, walkable neighborhood (with many amazing food options) when you want to just relax.",1.0
Chicago,"Ken's place was a home away from home.   It had gone above and beyond our expectations. The Nespresso is a life saver! Close to everything, about a 10 minute Uber from the location. It was nice to not have to worry about receiving a parking ticket because of the day passes provided. Would definitely recommend to anyone who wants to save money and still be comfortable and enjoy their trip.",1.0
Chicago,A great clean house with all the amenities you need. Attention to all the details at the house is commendable. Parking in the streets wasn't bad at all during our visit. Ken communicated with us really well and gave good suggestions of places to visit.,1.0
Chicago,This was one of the best Airbnb experiences I have had. Ken’s place was great and we loved all the amenities. The neighborhood was great and had a lot of fun restaurants. I would highly recommend and would definitely stay here again my next time in Chicago.,1.0
Chicago,I loved Ken’s place so much I thought about extending my trip just to hang out. Check in was super easy and convenient after a long day of driving. The home was very welcoming and comfortable. I especially appreciated the nespresso machine. I’ll definitely be back.,1.0
Chicago,"We can't say enough great things about Ken and Curt's home! They were so accommodating with any requests we had and made our stay so enjoyable. Everything in the home is labeled so there is no confusion. All instructions were there and easy to understand. The neighborhood was excellent, and home was beautifully done. We were there for a show at the United Center and this was a very short Uber ride away. There were so many unexpected perks in the home we weren't expecting either! If we are ever back in the area, we will surely be checking to see if this home is available!",1.0
Chicago,"We very much enjoyed Ken’s space, easy to get to, and it made our quick trip to Chicago very easy. Comfortable bed, nice pillows, cute entry garden area, easy entry to front access and space, good vibe. Labeled light switches...a host after my own heart. WiFi and other things clearly indicated. Nice proximity to the United Center (came to see 2Cellos), so thankful for included parking too. Very quiet, which was a surprise in Chicago! Ate dinner at Little Goat Diner, breakfast at Sweet Maple Cafe a short walk away. Highly recommend both! Thank you again for your hospitality. ❤️",1.0
Chicago,"Ken was a great host! His come is amazing and the experience staying there was outstanding! whenever i visit Chicago, i will be staying there again! He response quickly, he's attentive and welcoming. Close to downtown and other great places.",1.0
Chicago,"Our stay was perfect!  The space was beautiful (and made me want to go right home and redecorate!).  the location was great, we loved being able to walk just a couple of blocks to great restaurants.  Such a great calm and quiet retreat in the city!  The space was filled with everything we could possibly want or need, and the hosts checked in with us to see if they could do anything for us.  A dream trip!",1.0
Chicago,"This is easily the most wonderful Airbnb I’ve ever had the pleasure of staying in. The house is beautifully decorated in an adorable neighborhood that’s a 10 minute drive (or less!) to downtown. Our group had a lovely weekend there, we will absolutely book again next time we come to Chicago",1.0
Chicago,"I have to say - you cannot do any better than staying at Ken and Curt's Coach House.  If you have a chance - grab it!  These guys are a real ""class act"" and they provide a beautiful, comfortable and immaculate setting for your stay - all at a very reasonable price.  They have wonderful taste in their artwork and furnishings, and they are so generous in all the little extras they provide.  Really, I could go on and on - but it's better if you go and check out this terrific place on your own. You won't be sorry - I promise!",1.0
Chicago,"After reading all the glowing reviews for Ken and Curt's coach house, I was very excited to see the place for myself during my stay downtown.  Even then, I was surprised at how nice and well maintained everything was.  The beds and linens were super comfy, the bathroom and shower were updated and modern, and the kitchen and kitchenware are all high quality.  Ken was also incredibly responsive to any questions we had.  This was probably one of the best AirBnBs I've stayed at.",1.0
Chicago,We had high expectations for the Polk Coach House - and even our hopes didn't measure up to the great reality. Ken and Curt have made a truly comfortable oasis for their guests. High-end amenities and comfort. The location was fantastic; we walked from the United Center - and it was a fast car ride to Lake Shore Drive. Ken provided some written recommendations before our visit - plus they have a binder of suggestions and tips available in the Coach House. Great experience!,1.0
Chicago,"I cannot recommend this location enough.  It was my fiancé and I's first experience with Airbnb, and it will be hard to top I am sure.  The house is lovely, and has everything you could ask for with regards to comfort.  It is walking distance to several fabulous restaurants (even in horrid weather), and we had no trouble getting a Lyft to other places in the city.  Parking can be crowded!  However, the beds are comfy and the kitchen is amazing!  11/10 would definitely stay again.",1.0
Chicago,"Ken's place is outstanding. I'd give it six stars if I could.  Private, very clean well supplied with anything you might need while traveling. The beds and linens are luxurious and the place is decorated with fine taste. All the comforts of home with the added benefit of a great Chicago location. I truly hope to stay here again in the future.",1.0
Chicago,"The hardest part was leaving! One of the best places I’ve stayed. Easy access, easy communication and all around great location. Even for a super host this exceeded expectations and feels like a second home. Look forward to staying here again!",1.0
Chicago,"Stay here! Ken's Coach House is the best-outfitted Airbnb I've ever stayed in. Snacks, good coffee, a good collection of games and even Q-tips were touches that meaningfully improved our experience. The beds (including the sleeper sofa) were very comfortable and the furniture was quality. Everything you want out of an Airbnb -- well worth a few extra minutes walk to the train compared to other options.",1.0
Chicago,"I can’t say enough about Ken’s place.  Not only is it impeccably clean, but there are so many amenities and added special touches.  Definitely the most organized space my family has ever stayed in- they’ve thought of everything!  Thanks for a great stay.",1.0
Chicago,Best AirBnB experience to date. Ken and Curt's coach house provided the perfect base for our family of four to explore downtown Chicago. The public transit was close and seamless. The neighborhood is adorable and safe. The home was incredibly clean and maintained. The mid-century furnishings were a wonderful departure from the usual box store decor. Ken and Curt go beyond by providing some light snack mix and water for the weary traveler. Communication as well as check-in and check out were easy.  We absolutely plan a return trip in the future. We still have so much we want to see in Chicago.  Much gratitude!,1.0
Chicago,"We were in Chicago for a long weekend to visit friends and attend a concert, and the Coach House suited us perfectly.  Ken and Curt have obviously spent a lot of time and energy into making this unit a clean, quiet, relaxing and comfortable home away from home.  The furnishings and art work are superb, and we really enjoyed how they've clearly labelled everything around the unit.  The on-street parking and their recommendations were also very helpful.  And the location is great since there are a number of restaurants and bars within walking distance, and it is very easy to access other parts of the city.  It was very hard to leave, and we'll definitely stay here again when we're next in Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"I have stayed at other Airbnb which I have thoroughly enjoy but Ken's place far exceeds them all.  I went with two other ladies.  We felt very safe going to the train, as well as, walking in the dark to dinner.  We took the train to the Magnificent Mile and took a taxi back. It worked great. The amenities far exceeded my expectations.  He is a first class host with an adorable place.  I have already recommended his place to friends and family.",1.0
Chicago,"i was going to write a bad review, just to keep the competition for this apartment down. But i cant. it is a wonderful place. new clean and wonderfully equipped.  it is very quiet and i found it to restorative after hard days at work. the sauna was the best (LOL)",1.0
Chicago,"We were so incredibly lucky to find this place. This was a girls trip and none of us had ever been to Chicago before. We felt more than safe coming in and out of Ken & Curt’s coach house and felt safe knowing they were close by. We often find ourselves renting from hosts who own multiple properties and we rarely hear from them so I really loved that we were all on the same property as Ken and Curt. The space was clean, organized, and easy to find fully equipped with espresso pods and snacks. We would highly recommend this place and would love to stay again if we ever get the chance. Thank you guys again for having us!",1.0
Chicago,"Ken’s place was fantastic! Perfect for a intimate family gathering. The coach house is equip with everything you’d forget you’d need during your stay, and this makes it an extremely convenient option. It is also cozy and cute! Ken put a lot of thought behind this and it shows. Thanks again Ken for your wonderful hospitality!",1.0
Chicago,I enjoyed my stay at the beautiful Polk Street Coach House! It was very clean and I felt like home. Ken and Curt go above and beyond with their hospitality. They also have great recommendation and tips for your stay!,1.0
Chicago,"Ken and Curt’s place is perfect; a home away from home. We loved all the extra touches — great art and stylish space, snacks and nespresso, a booklet full of Chicago suggestions, extra Ventra cards, and even classical music playing upon our arrival! Their hospitality made this one of our favorite Airbnb experiences. Their place is also close to the pink and blue lines making it really easy to travel downtown. We did Uber Pool a couple of times and it cost anywhere between $5-$7 one way to get downtown. We were in the city to see Hamilton, but also went to the Art Institute Chicago and ate dinner at the Blue Door. Their place was easy to travel to between all those places. They also had great suggestions for places to eat in their neighborhood. We went to Sweet Maple and Stax for breakfast and Rosebud for dinner one night. All in all, such a great experience!",1.0
Chicago,"Incredible stay at the Polk Street Coach House. The space is stylish, yet comfortable and immaculately clean. Great amenities and attentive hosting. Will definitely be back next time we are in Chicago!",1.0
Chicago,"This place is close to perfection.  It is quiet and cozy.  Ken and Curt make it feel like home.  The location is close to food, drinks and transportation.  We parked our car and didn't move it until we left town.  Everything you may need is literally within a 3 block radius.  They were wonderful hosts.  They have tried to think of everything you may need and answer all your questions before you even have them.  They offered suggestions for food and entertainment.  They provided suggestions for sightseeing.  They provided information all over the house so that you would know how to do everything.  There were instruction on how the cable and surround sound worked.  Instructions on working the espresso machine.  Instructions on how the transportation system worked.  It made things so easy.  On top of all of that, they provided amenities that most do not.  There were back-up feminine supplies!  No one thinks of those type of small details.  There were towels, towels and more towels.  My favorite touch was the rubber duckie in the bathtub that was dressed in his Halloween costume.  We will definitely try to stay here everytime we come to Chicago.",1.0

Overall a great stay and highly reccommend.",1.0
Chicago,"The coach house was a perfect home-base for us during the Chicago Marathon weekend. Ken also offered a number of recommendations for local fare and attractions, and the house could not have been better equipped! We hosted some friends over for dinner and the kitchen was fully stocked with pots, pans, dishes, and silverware. We were very comfortable throughout our stay and would definitely stay there again!",1.0

Chicago,Ken was so quick to reply! I used my account to book a place for my boyfriend & his two friends that were visiting for a day. It was so perfect that he accepted my request since they had a last minute issue with the hotel they planned to stay at. The locations was great to be able to go show his friends the night life in the city. Highly recommend & a great price point compared to the average stay in that area!,1.0
Chicago,Ken's place was great! My friend and I had an amazing time in Chicago. The neighborhood is beautiful and has many stores to eat. We were using a taxi to go downtown and it was super close. I definitely recommend this place.,1.0
Chicago,"We absolutely loved Ken & Kurt's space. Clean, stylish, safe. Easy breezy check-in & the opportunity to leave bags in the garage prior to check-in and after check-out. Kind and courteous hosts; if you're  torn on locations - I implore you to choose the Polk Street Coach House ! Sending love :)",1.0
Chicago,"Everything about this Home is as advertised, plus more! The hosts take such care in ensuring their guests have anything they could possibly need. We had such an easy time maneuvering the city thanks to their tips and recommendations. Our group was made up of 5 adults and 1 toddler and we had no issues with the space. We look forward to our next stay!",1.0
Chicago,You get everything as advertised and more! The location was great; so close to so many restaurants. Everything felt safe and secure.

We loved our stay there and will definitely utilize their place again next time we’re in town!,1.0
Chicago,"We had a wonderful stay at Ken’s place.    Location: Close to transit, but far enough away to keep the street quiet, and not heavily trafficked. Beautiful parks nearby and a couple great restaurants just down the street. We particularly enjoyed Sweet Maple Cafe for breakfast and we enjoyed a great dinner at Rosebud. It was nice to have those options in walking distance, to cap busy days.  The space: Clean, comfortable, and beautifully styled with all the amenities plus some nice touches that set it apart from other Airbnb’s we’ve stayed at.   A great place to stay and we highly recommend it!",1.0
Chicago,The Polk Carriage House was tastefully decorated and provided everything.  The little extras made it feel like we were home and more.  We really enjoyed the little garden just outside the front door so we could sit outside and enjoy the evening.  If we visit Chicago again we hope to stay there.  Thank you both for an enjoyable stay.,1.0
Chicago,The Coach House is a beautifully designed and furnished space with wonderful amenities! We were very comfortable there. The location was perfect for us as we were in town to move our son in at UIC. The neighborhood feels very safe and restaurants are within easy walking distance. We hope to return when we can stay longer. Ken is a wonderful host and I highly recommend his place!,1.0
Chicago,"We've stayed in Airbnb's all over the US and Canada &  this is by far the best place we've ever stayed.  Ken has so many details that really take this place to the next level. Everything is clearly labeled so you're not searching for anything, the apt is very nice & very clean, the kitchen is well equipped and there is even a coffee maker with coffee!   If you have more than 2 people I would definitely recommend staying here. We had 4 adults and the space worked perfectly for us, there is plenty of room to spread out & not feel like you're all over each other. There were clear instructions on how to park (for free! - hard to find in Chicago).  Ken was always very quick to respond to any questions & very helpful with any questions we had.  We mainly used the train to get around which is a very short walk from the apt. We went to two Pearl Jam shows at Wrigley while we were visiting & got home very late after each of them and always felt safe in the area.  When we left to go home it was an easy walk to the blue line train that took us all the way to O'Hare.  The only thing that I'd wish we'd looked into before was how the pink line works (which is what we mostly used for getting downtown & back to the apt), the pink line runs on a loop so on the way to downtown it's only ~ 5 stops but on the way back it's ~ 10 stops because you have to do the whole loop.  We weren't expecting this extra time on the way back.  It wasn't a big deal but would have been nice to know too.  Again, this a great place and we'd recommend it 1000 times over!  Enjoy Chicago it's wonderful!",1.0
Chicago,"The Coach house was perfect - thoughtfully appointed, tastefully decorated, and conveniently located.  We enjoyed our stay thoroughly and would recommend it to anyone visiting Chicago, especially for events in West Town. ",1.0
Chicago,"My family and I could not be happier with staying here. Not only was the coach house immaculate, but it was cozy, inviting, and full of thoughtful touches. The space was just right for our group, felt safe and private despite being in the city.  The location was easy to get to and close to everything. Super convenient. We loved the notes that were placed around the space, made everything really easy to locate and use. The entire set up really helped us feel like we were in a home away from home. Not to mention the beds were extremely comfortable! Would definitely love to stay here again if ever in the Chicago area. I can’t say enough great things about this place- top notch!!!!",1.0
Chicago,Ken’s place is very comfortable and offers a location to base yourself from when your in the city. It is accommodating for both a party of adults or a family. Ken has the placed well stocked and it shines; it kind of makes you want to give a low rating so it will be available next time your in town!,1.0
Chicago,"Ken and Curt’s Polk House is probably the nicest Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in. Me, my husband, and another couple stayed at their place for a wedding weekend and we will definitely check if this place is available first the next time we come to Chicago. You can tell that Ken and Curt paid attention to every little detail and truly care about making their guests comfortable. Everything you need is there, it’s in a nice quiet neighborhood but very accessible to downtown, and there are detailed instructions and recommendations for pretty much anything you could think of. Thanks so much for hosting us, and we will definitely be back!",1.0
Chicago,"Ken is an amazing host! I've stayed in many, many airbnb's, and this one is one is my absolute favorite.

This place is so great that I do my best to arrange my work trips to Chicago at times when it's available. ",1.0
Chicago,"Top-notch guest house—loved it! Can’t say enough about the inviting decor, super-comfy beds (two well-appointed private bedrooms each with nice closet space, art, bedding and lighting), lovely and comfortable living and dining room areas, and fully-equipped kitchen with little extras (oils, seasonings, etc.) to help you if cooking.  Located in charming neighborhood just a few minute’s walk from Taylor St. (Little Italy), where we ate at four different places during our 4-day stay. Convenient and delicious options so close to home. And you will feel at home there! The Pink Line is just a few blocks away and offers excellent access to the city so you can just park the car for your visit (plenty of street parking but be comfortable parallel-parking just in case needed). The beautiful, modern guest house is thoughtfully set up for guests with everything including light switches labeled...instructions next to all appliances...plenty of cooking supplies and (Website hidden by Airbnb) conditioning...toiletries and comfy towels...plus plenty of visitor info and personal travel recommendations from the host. We appreciated the CTA cards left by other guests and left value on a few for the next guests as well. Loved the security features and felt very comfortable walking about though as in all areas of the city, you should use good street sense if venturing very far on foot. We did walk to the Jewel grocery store—which was an easy distance though I would be cautious doing so after dark (as you would do anywhere in the (Website hidden by Airbnb) special concerns). It was lovely to begin the day with morning coffee in the darling courtyard space (espresso and/or coffee, tea, cream and misc. snacks provided—thanks, Ken). I hope to stay at this wonderful guest house again and highly recommend it.",1.0
Chicago,"It doesn’t matter where you’re going in Chicago, this is where you should stay. Absolutely beautiful coach house with a lovely patio and decorated with the cutest mid-century modern decor.

Beautiful, roomy space in a great neighborhood close to restaurants and shopping. Ken is a wonderful host and we loved chatting with him throughout our trip. We will definitely come back whenever we are in Chicago!",1.0
Chicago,We travelled to Chicago for two Cubs games.  This was my first time using Airbnb. And it was an excellent experience! The home was so cozy and welcoming for our family. It was like I was staying in my own home with all of the personal touches.  My kids especially liked the stuffed animals that were there to greet us. They kind of grew attached to those. There was a lot of restaurants within a 5 minute walk.  The train was two blocks away.  And a local grocery was also very close.  We always felt safe in this neighborhood.   We hope to be back!,1.0
Chicago,"I was in town for the NeoCon Conference and the Coach House was the perfect escape from all the busy at the end of my photoshoot. I traveled with my mom and my kids and we were comfortable, delighted, and fell in love with the area.

Ken was a fantastic communicator and the small touches throughout the Coach House made our stay so easy and seamless.   We can't wait to return!",1.0

The beds were very comfy, the shower was great, and there were lots of little extras that made the stay extra pleasant - the complimentary coffee was very appreciated and we absolutely loved that there was a cabinet of games for us to play after a long day on our feet. Everywhere we needed to go was a quick lyft ride away which made getting around easy and convenient. Thank you for the lovely stay! ",1.0

We were given a list of sites and restaurants before the trip, and after we had settled, Ken introduced himself, gave us a short history of the area and reviewed places to eat and drink nearby.  I appreciated that the music was playing softly when we arrived, only because it showed attention to detail.  I hope that if I am in the area again, this place is available.",1.0
Chicago,"We can’t recommend Ken & Curt’s coach house enough!  We stayed for 4 nights and can fully recommend this home. Communication with our hosts was always helpful, prompt and very friendly, check-in and out were easy and secure, and the house was spotless and stylish. It had all the amenities we needed plus some, including super comfy beds and linens, stylish and comfortable furniture, a very nice bathroom, and a full kitchen including great cookware, dishes & a high quality Nespresso maker (great espresso & steamed milk!), as well as a multitude of snacks. We appreciated all the little touches to make our stay convenient and homey, including Ken’s intro to the home & the neighborhood when we arrived. The parking passes were great & we found parking to be easy (especially on weekends.) The location is super convenient — a couple of blocks from the Pink line which takes you into the Loop & downtown in no time (plus other bus routes), a few blocks from I-290 (Ashland exit) if you’re driving, and an easy walk to a couple of parks, a grocery store, and a large number of great restaurants along Taylor Street.

We can’t wait to return on future trips to Chicago!",1.0

Grace was very quick to respond and was amazing to accommodate us with our flights and check-in. Would love to stay here again when I’m back in Chicago",1.0
Chicago,"Grace’s place was amazing! I come to Chicago every October and her place has been one of my favorites. While reading the reviews, I read one that was very critical about the stairs and uneven floors, the review made it seem far worst than it really is. Yes the stairs are steep, but they were completely manageable. The uneven floors were hardly noticeable, and the sink worked fine for us and I’m 5’9. Her place was very charming with cute touches me and my friend’s really enjoyed. She responded fast, cleared up any questions we had, and never heard any noise from her which was a problem we had last year when we stayed in a mother in law suite. I recommend her place and would stay there again in the future.",1.0
Chicago,"Classic Chicago building, charmingly vintage and well maintained.  Grace provided everything we needed.  The location was great for us and very convenient to the Blue line.

Chicago,"Grace’s place is sparkling clean. Even on barefoot you wouldn’t feel dust on your feet. The place is so stylish and I love the simple touches on every part of her house. It is a great value for money being a 2bedroom and can also accommodate more people with the 2sofabeds in the living room. The kitchen is complete with stove, oven, microwave, fridge, cooking ware and utensils. The place is very close to grocery store, some resto and the Belmont Blue station. This is such a great place and I will definitely stay again when i go back to Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"Grace's space was quite simply amazing. Public transport within walking distance and Uber's all around the area made seeing Chicago a breeze.

Chicago,Jay & Elisa’s loft was absolutely amazing! Perfect location right next to the L and an easy walk to Wrigley.

This enabled us to do a tour without having to worry about our luggage.  There are steps to climb to get to the loft. Two nights were warm and the AC is set on auto at 68 degrees.

You will not be disappointed staying here!",1.0

Just don’t turn it down too much or the brick will win.   The home is close to everything you need whether it be food or the train.   I found nothing to complain about. Ok, two things: 1) the cable doesn’t have CNN or ESPN. But I survived. 2) I had to leave too soon! I wanted to stay longer!   Jay and Elisa hit a homer with their home.   -Brian",1.0

Also, it was such a great location, which made for easy walking and transportation to major attractions. Would easily stay here again versus a hotel.",1.0
Chicago,"We couldn’t  have chosen a better place to stay for our trip to Chicago. Location was perfect for us. We walked everywhere tho plenty of public transportation of all kinds was available nearby. The apartment was perfect for the two of us, light and airy with a whole wall of windows. Jing was a very considerate host checking to make sure we were comfortable and if there was anything we needed. Check in and out was easy, the accommodations were good and the experience was everything we expected. We enjoy this so much more than a hotel. We’d definitely recommend it to friends or family and would stay again ourselves if we ever go back to Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"Jing’s place was perfect for my friend and I to stay for a couple of days to visit Chicago. The location was great, we could walk everywhere or it was only a quick and cheap Uber or Lyft. Checking in was easy and coming in and out was no trouble at all. The only thing is there isn’t a full length mirror for two young millennials to check out their outfits before heading out ;) over all a great place. I will definitely be back!!",1.0
Chicago,What an amazing BnB! Extremely secure apartment that overlooks the city. It is centrally located and has many bus/train stops around you to easy move around Chicago with public transit only $40 for a 3 day pass. This apartment is extremely clean with a very comfortable setup and bed.  Would definitely stay here again!!,1.0
Chicago,"Jing's place was immaculately clean and very well appointed. Jing also was very quick to communicate with me about any questions or concerns. The view from the apartment is spectacular and parking is readily available for those that need it. The location is ideal, especially if you need to be near downtown. The immediate area is safe and their is lots to do and see. Consider going to get Pizza at Lou Malnatti's. It's a 10 to 15 minute walk and the pizza is among my favorite anywhere.   The only thing that may be of concern to some tenants is that their is limited control over the temperature which is mostly set by the building. I was able to tweak the dial and that helped some.  If highly granular control of the temperature setting is important, then keep this in mind.    I highly recommend Jing's place.",1.0
Chicago,"Great unit! This extremely tidy apartment was perfect for a weekend trip. The unit looks over a major expressway but you aren’t bothered by street level noise and it creates a great view of the western  cityscape. You will be in walking distance to Greek Town and local favorites like Lou Mitchell’s.   The kitchen, bathroom, and pantry were well stocked  in case you want to cook or need to restock the paper towels. Clean linens and extra blankets made for a very comfortable stay.   Parking- 24hrs for $15. The covered walkway from the garage to the residential tower was very convenient given the rainy weekend. If you park in the building’s garage, be aware that you’ll be walking a little while to get to the unit. The staff at the front desk was very friendly and will point you in the right direction.   Jing provides timely and useful responses to messages before and during the stay. Highly recommend booking.",1.0
Chicago,"Jing's place was beautiful, loved the location and the view in his unit. Being downtown Chicago I wanted a spot where I felt safe and not too spendy and Jing's place was perfect. I would definitely book here again if I were ever in Chicago again. Jing is also very fast at responding so I felt comfortable asking him questions.   My favorite spot the French Market, which was just a couple blocks away. Overall the safe and convenient environment made Jing's place the perfect place to book.",1.0
Chicago,"Ridiculously good location. Clean, spacious place with a great view. You can watch the United Center start to light up at night two miles up the road. Two grocery stores and great breakfast, lunch, and dinner spots within walking distance. Rapid responses from the host. It was a great spot and I'd happily go back.",1.0
Chicago,This cozy and clean apartment is in a very nice building. I've stayed in a lot of airbnb spots in Chicago and this was one of the more luxurious stays I've had and at such a cheap price! The bags of goldfish crackers on the counter definitely sealed the deal too :),1.0

Chicago,"Jing was quick to respond and check in directions were clear and easy. The stay was peaceful, comfortable, and beautiful with the view of the city.

Chicago,"I highly recommend this accommodation. The view is fantastic and the whole complex is secure, sophisticated and overall a great value.

The height of the unit allowed for spectacular views. Thank you!",1.0

Chicago,"Now I know why they call you a super host because your place was super cool! Also, thanks for giving us the opportunity to stay at your place while in Chicago. It was a good experience! Love how you had snacks available for us because I really do love snacks so that’s definitely a plus for as well as the other stuff available in the house like toilet paper, soap, shampoo and etc. Although, we had our own supplies it was just convenient knowing that the supplies were there if we needed it. Last, but not least the sky view of the place is absolutely breathtaking. How beautiful to wake up to and go to sleep to the beautiful view. If I’m ever in Chicago, I would most definitely book and recommend others to book at your place.",1.0
Chicago,"The view is amazing!  Just a note, the bedroom does not close 100%,  but great use of space.  Full sized appliances in the kitchen, beautifully decorated.  Jing communicates very promptly and accomadated a special request for us.",1.0
Chicago,"Jing’s high rise luxury apartment was impeccably clean and well equipped and conveniently located in a very safe part of Chicago. She even left yummy snacks for us and was readily available and reachable during our stay. We experienced some wifi connectivity issues on the first night, but through clear communication, everything was resolved smoothly. 10/10 would come back again! ",1.0
Chicago,"AMAZING!! location is terrific! Jing has everything you need to cook, provided shampoo, towels and soap. Snacks (Pringles & goldfish) were available. The view is just incredible.. I can not say enough great things about this apartment! Was sad to leave! ",1.0
Chicago,"Our overall stay is amazing! The view of Chicago’s skyline from the big glass window is spectacular. The apartment is very stylish and neat with amenities and supplies that suit all our needs (we cooked). Jing also gave us complimentary snacks! The bed sheets, however, are not very clean. They probably haven’t been washed since last visitor’s stay. Public transportation is very convenient. Walkable distance to groceries like H-mart and Whole Foods.",1.0
Chicago,"Such a great Airbnb!! An amazing view, and super cute and clean apartment. I definitely recommend staying here. The parking is 40$ per 24hrs, so prepare for that. But it was an amazing place. 10/10.  ",1.0
Chicago,"This was my second time being in Chicago. The location is perfect in downtown. It’s near one of the best burger joint in town; Au Cheval. I highly recommend it. Views from the place were amazing. If I went back to Chicago, I would stay here again.",1.0
Chicago,"This place was pretty nice. It was very affordable for Chicago. I was looking at hotels and hostels and this place was still cheaper.   It is in a fairly residential area but it is close to some of the most popular restaurants in Chicago. It takes 10 minutes to walk to those resturants. Also it is close to the Willis Tower and Millennium Park. Everything in downtown is fairly walk-able from this airbnb. If not, there are buses. One down side may be the lack of quick easy to access places to eat other than the popular chains. I felt like everything closed to early round this area and on the weekend it felt like many of the stores were also closed.  The room was amazing. It is on the 44th floor so super high up and you get a great view. The rooms was fairly clean, really no complaints. I think the central air was a downside, it was super dry and a little chilly. But I didn't try to turn the heat or ac on. Also the space is really cute, perfect for a couple or an individual traveling to Chicago.   The owner was super nice. He let me check in early. Though I felt like I rushed him with the cleaning since I checked in early but he was really nice. Communication was easy, he responded to everything right away. He even check in with us half way through our stay, which was thoughtful.   Great stay! I recommend it!",1.0
Chicago,"Jing was an amazing and responsive host! He was really accommodating of our needs and the space itself was really nice, clean, and had a beautiful view of the city! The towers were in a great location and I would definitely stay here the next time I come to Chicago. Thank you!!",1.0

Chicago,"Great location, short walk from the red line train. The apartment space was spacious and comfortable. Lots of board games and DVD's. Easy parking on the street, so overall the place was perfect for our needs for a quick family visit and night out to Wrigley stadium. Wish we could have explored the area more! Great value for great price. Thanks!!!",1.0
Chicago,"Joshua was very quick to get back to us when we wrote him with questions, and was very accommodating with our schedules. The space was fantastic, everything was very clean, and the many USB charging ports was a very nice touch. We'd definitely stay again if we come back for another visit!",1.0
Chicago,Really nice place with a great host to go with it. His dog is super cute and playful as well (added bonus for pet lovers). The neighborhood is beautiful and a great place to go walking anytime of day with many shops within walking distance of the house. Would recommend to anyone looking for a great place to stay in Chicago.,1.0
Chicago,We scheduled lodging with another host.  The other host never responded & gave us check in info.  Long story short the reservation had to be cancelled the day of the reservation. We were stuck out in the rain & afraid that we might be homeless for ther night.  So fortunate that Joshua was very responsive & made a point to be available for us.  He responded to our last minute reservation request & was very accommodating. Thanks again Joshua!,1.0
Chicago,Spacious condo living space with a nice living room. Josh was very quick on responses and his dog Harriet was super friendly. We didn't get to stay in the room much but it felt really homey and comfortable when we were there.,1.0
Chicago,"I was interested in a place near Loyola-Chicago and enjoyed the close proximity of Joshua's to campus. The street is pleasant and the neighborhood diverse, both of which I appreciated. Having everything needed in one spot, an entire floor with mini-kitchenette, made the time there easy and relaxing. Nice nights of sleep in a quiet area and in a comfy bed. Convenient to downtown via various transportation, and many options in the neighborhood. A pleasant, accommodating host.",1.0
Chicago,"Joshua’s place is really spacious. We apppreciated that we could set up our so. To sleep on the air mattress out of the way on the living space while my husband and I were in the (also spacious) bedroom. If we had small kids who needed to be in the same room, there was also plenty of room for the air mattress in the bedroom.  The coffee table provided the perfect card table for the four of us. And I even fit in a movie from Joshua’s collection of DVDs.   I was worried about not having a kitchen, but that turned out to be fine. The mini fridge was great for the food we travel with, plus leftovers.",1.0
Chicago,"Much larger than I expected. Lots of privacy and space. Extra blankets and towels should it get chilly, but also a space heater if needed.  Little things like coffee and bottles of water add a nice touch. Very nice area worth little shops and places to eat nearby, even a grocery store right up the street. Kinda wish it was my apartment it's so cozy!",1.0
Chicago,"Our stay at Joshua's place was great. Joshua was very flexible with check-in/check-out time, the place was clean and organized, plenty of charging stations throughout the condo. Washer, dryer, refrigerator were available as was access to Netflix etc. Location of the condo was within walking distance to a number of restaurants, walgreens/cvs, and reasonable distance by Uber to entertainment. At the rate he charges ($51/night), I would absolutely stay at Joshua's again next time I'm in the area.",1.0
Chicago,"Joshua’s place is very nice. It’s a great value for Chicago. It’s a bit of a drive from the downtown area of Chicago if you’re looking to do touristy things but this wasn’t a problem for us as we just took an Uber into downtown and stayed there all day. There are a few nice little restaurants near Joshua’s place as well that are within walking distance. It does get a little cold but Joshua is a great host and  he provides a heater for guests. Overall, a great stay!",1.0

Chicago,"Josh’s place was our first AirBnB experience and did not disappoint at all! Check in process was easy and the dog, Harriett, was an amazing greeter. Entire place was spotless, comfortable, and welcoming! We’re hoping to return to visit Chicago in the summer.  This was also our first time visiting Chicago and the location of Josh’s was perfect for that! We had great strolls through nearby Rogers Park and Edgewater, and with a short Lyft/Uber ride we were right in downtown Chicago!",1.0
Chicago,This is by far the best air bnb I’ve stayed in. Josh was very accommodating and his place was sparkling clean. He had charging stations in the bedroom and out in the living room. He had chips and water bottles out for us when we arrived. I will definitely be booking another stay here.,1.0
Chicago,"Joshua’s place was great! I was taking a weekend class near Loyola university, and Joshua‘s place made for an easy walk. When staying here, you have the run of the downstairs - bedroom, bathroom, tv/sitting area, loaded bookshelf, and washer/dryer if you need it. Joshua’s frequency and ease of communication was outstanding. Due to my all-day classes and his work schedule, we only spoke directly a couple of times, but he was very helpful and willing to offer suggestions of local eateries, etc. And his pup is always up for getting and giving attention (ok, mostly getting attention!).  Thanks Joshua, I had a great stay and will stay again if it’s available!",1.0
Chicago,"This spot worked great for my husband and I and young son.  We liked having a bedroom and then separate space for him to sleep.  The little area with fridge and microwave was great as well.  While we were only there for one night, the communication was quick, and the accommodations were great.   We walked to a good little diner for breakfast in the morning.    Would stay here again!",1.0
Chicago,Josh's place is very comfy  The bed is nice. It is a basement apt so it's a little chilly in the winter. There is a mini fridge and microwave  His dog Harriet is young and very friendly. We had a nice stay   Thanks Josh !,1.0

This place is a great value and the neighborhood was nice!,1.0
Chicago,"A very nice comfy and quiet place to stay while in Chicago. The bus stop is very close and that can take you to the train that isn't far away. There is really cool Indian section(not far away on Glennwood) with some authentic and delicious Indian restaurants. You won't find a nicer host, than Joshua. I'm fairly new to airbnb and he was very patient with me asking him so many questions. His dog, Harry is super cute, but you should like dogs or not be afraid of them. I highly recommend to stay at Joshua's place.",1.0
Chicago,"This place is amazing! clean, spacious and very comfortable. Joshua is one of the best host I've ever encountered on Airbnb.

The apartment was immaculately clean and well furnished, and we definitely enjoyed our time in the city more with the peace of mind that we were staying at such a great place. Thanks again Joshua!",1.0
Chicago,"Before we even got to the home, Joshua was already an outstanding host. Having never been to Chicago, he was incredibly helpful with transportation options, as well as with recommendations on local restaurants. The space itself was clean and very spacious. Proximity to lots of great restaurants and near to the Red Line going downtown. We already are excited to go back to Chicago and would love to stay at Joshua’s again.",1.0
Chicago,"Joshua's place is the perfect place to stay in Chicago! Nestled in a lively but quiet corner of Edgewater and Rogers Park, Joshua has an entire floor of privacy and comfort set aside for his guests. There's a bookshelf full of amazing books, and if you just need it as a place to sleep, you can quietly enter and leave the backdoor. Highly recommended for your stay! His doggo is also literally the best doggo, incredibly friendly and excited to meet you.",1.0
Chicago,"Joshua's place is huge and private and has everything you would need for a short trip including good wifi, laundry machine, mini fridge and microwave, unless you are set on cooking (no stove). There is even a fluffy dog to greet you :) The neighborhood is safe and walkable, even at night. We left our car parked in the street and took the red line or, since the weather was spectacular, Divvy bikes down the lakeshore bike trail (which starts a few blocks down near the Bryn Mawr station) into downtown each day. Both were convenient and easy to do. We even ended up extending our stay by a night which Joshua made very easy. Would definitely recommend everything about this place.",1.0
Chicago,"Joshua is a wonderful host. He couldn't meet us at check-in, so sent pics and instructions for the lock box. Really easy. Left us some mints and chips and drinks and everything was in order for our stay. We had the whole basement to the condo, which is itself a full apartment. Comfy and clean. Wish we'd had more time to stay there to hang out in it and read from the interesting books. Fast communication before and during our stay. If it's available, I'll certainly be staying there next time I need a place in Chicago. Many thanks, Joshua!",1.0

Chicago,"Joshua’s place was everything that was promised. It was so great to have the entire floor to ourselves. We felt safe the entire time in his neighborhood and, even though we rarely saw him because of our different schedules, he was extremely helpful when needed and was quick at responding. My friend and I were within feet from a popular bus route stop and also about 10 minutes walking distance from the train station. This location is north of downtown Chicago. It was great to visit the city and then enjoy a calming, peaceful evening back at Joshua’s place to rest up for the night. We had a great time and would definitely stay here again. An added bonus was his adorable and welcoming dog, Harriet! She’s the cutest!",1.0
Chicago,"Joshua was an amazing host and communicated quickly with us on all things. My parents needed a place to stay for 3 weeks and this was the ideal space for them with it being a couple of blocks from my place. My parents were able to live comfortably in the space and Joshua was very nice in helping them with certain needs from time to time.  The place is clean and well maintained. The kitchenette is small but functional but not a place to cook an expansive dinner. Rest of the amenities are awesome in this place including access to TV, wifi, heater (for winter), books and laundry.",1.0

Chicago,Joshua was very prepared and had all of the amenities one could hope for. There is also a lot of space for multiple guests. He was friendly and accommodating.

The lower level wasn't extremely cold and there were blankets and a space heater but wearing warm pj's helps.,1.0
Chicago,"Thanks to Joshua for making our first trip together to Chicago an easy one. He was able to communicate well with us, recommend and offer locations to visit and his puppy Harriet was wonderful.

Chicago,"My wife and I have stayed in lots of Airbnb's in many cities and this is easily the best shared space we've experienced. The lower floor of the apartment is spacious, private, comfortable and well priced. Josh, the host, was pleasant and helpful, and very flexible when our travel plans we seriously altered at the last minute by bad weather. All in all, a wonderful place.",1.0
Chicago,"Very nice space, Joshua was very responsive in helping us plan and on the day of arrival.  Part of the reason for my trip was that the board of a non-profit I'm involved with was getting together. We were struggling to find a space and although we didn't end up hosting the meeting at Joshua's he was not only prepared to let us use the rental space, but to also use his dining room.   Everything was clean and comfortable. If you're a light sleeper you may hear when anyone walks around upstairs, but didn't bother us.   Was nice to be able to relax one night and watch a movie on the TV. ",1.0

The apartment is a beautifully laid-out and decorated studio. It was just me this trip, but there would have been plenty of room for a second person. The kitchen is well-equipped and the bathroom is spacious. The towels were fluffy and soft and the sheets felt amazing -- I slept like a baby. This apartment felt like I was actually staying at a friend's place, not just stopping by a rental. The neighborhood has great restaurants/pubs within the block and there are many, many stores, restaurants, gyms, and everything else you might need within a mile walk of the apartment. The brown line is about 1/10 of a mile away and I was able to get into the Loop in less than 15 minutes. This is a great spot!",1.0

Chicago,"Great little space in Old Town. Nice location, cozy, and clean. Lynn was very responsive with check-in (which was a keypad, always convenient) and questions I had on the wifi. Place was as described, and in the summer months it was nice to have the air conditioner.   The only very minor thing was the internet goes off 2x a day, once in the afternoon and one in the early AM. Unfortunately due to jet lag I was usually home and needing to work whenever it would shut off for 30-45 mins. Not a huge deal, but if you're planning on working from there a small thing to consider.   Overall great place though!",1.0
Chicago,"Lynn's place was perfect for my stay in Chicago. She provided everything I needed and was there to greet me for check-in. The place was just as pictured.

Really appreciated the keurig coffee maker and pods-  Plenty of towels and nice shower. Will definitely stay again on our next visit. This beat going back to a hotel room after a long day! Thanks Lynn!,1.0

Chicago,"If you are looking for the best location to stay in Chicago, Old Town is it and Lynn’s apartment is right in the middle.  Lovely neighbourhood with heaps of cafes, restaurants, grocery stores, pharmacy and laundries.  I would recommend theTwin Anchors Tavern across the road for great BBQ and atmosphere and Abobo Grill has tasty Mexican. The “L” metro is a short walk and can be used to get into the city, to the airport and most places around Chicago.  Also it is a good walking neighbourhood and you can walk along the lake into the city. Lynn place is as described and on the ground floor which is a bonus.  Easy access and good communication.  A well supplied kitchen and comfy bed.  We meet Lynn and her son Nick who help us out getting tickets for the baseball. Highly recommend for a couple spending some time in Chicago.",1.0

Chicago,"Anne's place was great!  She let us drop off our bags a few hours early before her already already check-in which was great!  The check-in and check-out process was extremely easy.  The location was pretty good, about a 15-20 minute walk to River North area.  Very close to the Bean and the museums and a quick drive to the main highway to get to the upper areas of the city.  Lyft rides were all about $5-$15 which was great!  Bed was comfortable, pillows were pretty flat but not terrible.  The place was very clean and I felt safe the entire time with a secure lock on our bedroom door.  In comparing the prices when looking at Chicago, this was by far the cheapest and despite it being a ""shared"" airbnb, it felt like a hotel (since we had an Ensuite) just a LOT cheaper!  Also about a 1 minute walk to Gino's which was my favorite of all the deep dish pizza that I tried in Chicago!   Also very conveniently located across the street from a 7/11 that was either open very late or 24/7!

Chicago,"I strongly recommend Anne's apartment! I was surprised by how many extra amenities were in the apartment - a small desk in the bedroom I stayed in, multiple extension cords in different areas of the room for ease of charging, huggable hangers for clothes, a blow dryer in the bathroom. The apartment was incredibly clean and decorated beautifully - there was framed art pieces all around which I felt added a really nice touch.

There was even a Starbucks on the corner which I really appreciated!",1.0

Chicago,"This is an amazing value in a great location! Walkable to many destinations, and a short, cheap ride almost anywhere else. As a solo female traveler (who is kind of a chicken), I felt completely safe and comfy in Anne's place. Very comfortable bed and private bath.

Her place is clean, safe, and very comfortable! I would rate my entire stay a 9.75 out of 10! The .25 was out of Anne's control... the night time city street noise (cars honking, trucks, etc...) carried up to the floor where the apartment was, and interrupted what was a good night's sleep. If you need a nice, clean, place in Chicago with a dependable hostess, Anne is for you!!",1.0

Chicago,Kinda hard to locate the building entrance/doors at first but after that it was a smooth transaction to getting the keys for the room. This airbnb is a prime in terms of location because it is about the same walking distance (less than 5 min) to many major train and bus stops.,1.0
Chicago,"Host: We had the opportunity to meet her personally and she was very warm, friendly and welcoming! She was very prompt and quick with all her responses and that will always be appreciated!  Check-in/Check-out: Very simple instructions and the hours are very flexible! This made it really convenient for us since we made last minute changes to our schedule. Just message her to see if the check in time can be adjusted and like I said, she's super prompt with responses  Location: This is one of the best spots in the city for sure! This is walking distance of EVERYTHING so we basically walked most of the time but if you're not up for it and would like the public transportation, bus stops are everywhere in the area and the train station (red line, I believe) is close.   Unit: Very clean and stylish! The kitchen had pretty much what we needed since we brought some food to cook. Bathroom was clean and the sheets were freshly laundried. You will hear a bit of the street noise but nothing too bad and unexpected (it is in the middle of downtown after all)   Overall, this was the best possible option for us and very glad we got to stay at Anne's place!",1.0
Chicago,"Nicer than the pictures show! Clean and airy common areas, space to spread out in the dining/living room if the private space isn't enough. Full size kitchen.

The hosts were easy to get ahold of, kind, and even changed a lightbulb for us within the hour! The location is great. Located close to public transit, or you can Uber/Lyft to downtown in about 10-15 minutes.

This was home base for our mini-moon getaway from Milwaukee, and it was perfect proximity from anywhere we wanted to go, as well as very comfy and cozy for when we just wanted to be lazy and relax!  As noted, hosts do have three dogs which can be heard upstairs, but it was never an issue for us and they have earplugs available if needed.  A sweet touch was a mini bottle of bubbly in the fridge, I assume on account of us indicating that we were honeymooning.  Would absolutely stay again.",1.0

The space itself is really a hidden gem tucked away behind a lovely garden for privacy and quiet. The loft was so unique and charming and they did a great job to maximize the space. It’s very functional but stylish. Just a note to be careful on the steps approaching the bed/loft area and to watch your head as it’s a bit of a low clearance.   We had an easy time street parking our car directly outside the unit which was extremely convenient and one less thing to have to worry about. We also appreciated the easy self check-in/out process.   The location was convenient to exploring some really cool shops, bars, and restaurants nearby. It was a great way to experience some local flavor outside of the more touristy stuff.   Thanks for a great visit! ",1.0

As well, the neighborhood is very cool.   It is close to many other fun areas of west Chicago.  Not far from downtown either.   We didn’t even find a need to go to the magnificent mile.   There is too much fun to be had hanging out in this area of town.   We did go to Logan’s Square a bit.  It’s very close.   Loads of good bars and food.    We would definitely stay here again.

Chicago,Jose and his family are warm and friendly and made us feel welcomed to stay in their first floor apt. They live in a safe neighborhood with a school a block away with a playground that has lots of equipment to work out on. We did this at 8 pm with many others enjoying the rubber coated track etc. Street parking is limited but we didn't need it with a space provided right in front of our apt. It was very quiet at night and our rental was clean with everything we needed and more. They even gave us tomatoes and peppers from their healthy garden. We will use Jose's place again on our next stay in Chicago.,1.0
Chicago,"Place is as expected, nice clean and comfy. The host messaged us a couple of times to make sure we’re doing alright and if we needed anything. Made the check-in super easy.

Jose accommodated my family in every way possible, from letting us check in early, drove us to our event we were in town for & gave great suggestions of places to visit, eat & easiest ways to get around Chicago.

Chicago,"We stayed for 5 days, and had a very enjoyable stay. Jose was very friendly and answered any questions quickly. He gave us restaurant recommendations, which definitely made our stay better! You can hear his family walking in the apartment upstairs, but that is the nature of apartment living, and did not detract at all from the loveliness of the apartment. The driveway to park in was a definite bonus, it helped us save money by driving in instead of flying. It's nearby public transportation, so we left our car in the driveway and avoided having to pay for parking all week. We would definitely stay here again if we find ourselves in Chicago once more.",1.0
Chicago,A fantastic place to stay with a very kind and generous host. Great open floor plan that’s warm and inviting. We could not have been happier and are so glad to have met Jose who truly made our experience worthwhile.  Five stars!,1.0

Paco's Tacos was some of the best tacos I have ever had (thanks for the recommendation, Jose!).

Jose went out of his way (twice) to accommodate some of our more specific needs. Loved that there was parking and felt very safe in the neighborhood.

Chicago,"Jose’s place was incredibly nice and clean. He was a great host and frequently checked-in on how we were doing. The only downside was that we were able to hear his family walk around upstairs; however, he warns guests in the description and when we arrived. It was not too distracting. We appreciated how close the bus station was to his house. Additionally, he provided guidance on how to get to local grocery stores and transportation spots. Would greatly recommend!",1.0
Chicago,Jose depicts the place perfectly in his description. The place is spacious and private and quiet. Very clean and the open concept is awesome.

What more could you ask for? Thank you for your hospitality, Jose!",1.0
Chicago,"Jose’s place was everything I needed and more this weekend. Perfect location to the airport. The set up was very beautiful, everything was clean and neat. He responded very quickly.

Chicago,Jose was great!  He met us at the drive way and showed us around his home. His hospitality was impeccable. He had a list of local restaurants and places to go. We were traveling with two toddlers and the place was spacious enough for our kids to run around and place inside. The neighborhood is safe and clean. Lots of families and schools and the BEST Mexican cuisine we’ve had in years!   The smart tv was perfect for using our mobile devices for streaming. The WiFi was super fast. And the best we’re very comfortable.,1.0

Chicago,"Great place. Easy stay. We mostly needed a spot to crash after long days exploring the city. Jose's place was outside of downtown (about a 30 minute car ride, more w/ traffic), but it was exactly what we needed: affordable, secure, clean, spacious, and a kitchen too. Jose was really responsive and very helpful. Newly remodeled, no frills, but great space. I highly recommend walking to a local taco shop at least once. Paco's Tacos is a 5 minute walk away - really great food.",1.0
Chicago,"Jose’s apartment is spacious, very clean and everything you need is there. Parking  was easy.  Public transportation is near, a bus wich we did not use.

The private bathroom was immaculate when I arrived, as was the room. The bathroom has a backlit mirror, which made makeup application a breeze! Plenty of towels of all sizes were provided.

I would definitely book here again!",1.0

His place was very clean which is always at the top of my list when looking for places to stay.  The price is also great for how amazing of an experience he makes the stay - you will not want to stay anywhere else once you stay here.  13/10 would recommend staying here & I will be staying here again in the future.",1.0
Chicago,"Staying at Nathan’s was perfect! I needed a place in that neighborhood so I could quickly walk to visit my son in East Lakeside so the location was ideal, and the primary reason for booking the room. Nathan reaches out quickly and stayed in touch with transit tips so I arrived smoothly. Extra features were chocolates and great coffee with actual cream!

Chicago,"Nathan's place is just great.  I give it a glowing review.  Cleanliness is A+.  Location, communication with Nathan, a very open floorpan in his home. Access to public transportation, parking within a couple of blocks all work out great. Lot's of windows in Nathan's place keep everything bright, yet you still have plenty of privacy in your own bedroom & bathroom. Probably one of the best AirBnB experiences I've ever had.

Highly recommend to other travellers and I would rebook without hesitation. Thanks again for a great stay in Chicago. This is the place to be if your wanting to stay in Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"I greatly enjoyed my stay at Anne’s place in the “loop”. A lovely apartment in an old-fashioned high rise residential building, the bedroom is spacious and tastefully furnished. This has by far been my best experience with an Airbnb. The en suite bathroom is a huge perk to me. I met Anne briefly when I checked in and she was very gracious. I will definitely look to stay at Anne’s again the next time I’m in the area.",1.0
Chicago,"Amazing location by Millennium Park and clean. Bathroom is inside the room so you don’t have to worry about disturbing other guests or interact if you don’t want to. Overall, everything we needed. Check-in was painless. Anne was very prompt with her responses.",1.0
Chicago,"This was my first AirBnB experience and it far surpassed my expectations! Private bedroom (very large) and bathroom. Maybe the most convenient location to stay at in the city - buses, trains, and it’s very walkable to tourist spots. Plus a slew of coffee shops and places to grab a bite to eat. I’m surprised the price isn’t higher for all that is offered.",1.0
Chicago,"What a great location! The room was spacious, Anne responded quickly, and she gave me lots of privacy while making sure that I knew that I could reach out if I had questions. Would stay there next time I'm in town.",1.0
Chicago,"The apartment is safe, clean, and beautifully decorated, and both of the bedrooms have a great view of Willis tower and the Chicago skyline. Anne was very friendly, welcoming, and helpful. The bed in my room was very comfortable, and noise levels from the street in the evenings were low, particularly considering how embedded this place is in the heart of the city.   The apartment felt very centrally located for everything I wanted to do in Chicago. The walk to my conference at the Chicago Hilton was about 5 minutes, and it took about 15 minutes on foot to stroll over to Millennium Park and the other areas of the Chicago waterfront. I couldn't recommend this place enough if you're visiting the Loop, and I will definitely be returning the next time I have a conference in the area.",1.0
Chicago,"Anne’s place was perfect for my weekend in Chicago. Super central, steps away from transit and everything. Came through when another Airbnb host canceled on my last minute and saved the day. Couldn’t recommend enough.",1.0
Chicago,Anne’s place is perfect for you if you’re a weekend traveler that has any amount of experience with chicago streets. You’re right in the middle of the loop and even next door to a starbucks! The room itself is inviting and cozy. I would definitely stay here again!,1.0
Chicago,"Anne's apartment was perfect for my needs. The location was just right for my school visit, and would be great for a downtown vacation as well. Anne was available for assistance, but allowed me my privacy. The bed was comfortable and on the firm side. No one else was staying in the apartment during my stay, but either way I am glad I had a private bathroom. Thanks for a wonderful stay!",1.0
Chicago,"Location can’t be beat, right smack dab in Chicago. Lotsa restaurants and bars and little shops around. Quick few blocks walk to the parks- I walked from apt to Millennium Park in 18 mins, and even in January temperatures, it was a lovely walk. The apartment is cozy, I wanted a bit more heat and after texting to ask Anne, she said yes I can adjust the thermostat. The bed is comfy, no weird smells in the building or apartment. I had to put an air diffuser away in bathroom cabinets because it was strong for my sensitive nose but other than that it was perfect. Living room area is lovely and comfy too! The room had a good lock on the door so it really felt secure. Don’t hesitate to book this awesome place!",1.0
Chicago,"I was in town for a few days for a conference and this place was wonderful. It is centrally located, a short walk to Millennium Park, and close to public transit. The apartment is also really quite nice, perfectly clean, and about as nice as I could have desired. Check-in was a breeze, even though I arrived at 1am, and checking out was easy as well. Anne responded to messages quickly and answered all of my questions. Would stay here again in a heartbeat.",1.0
Chicago,"The room is cozy and clean. The location is perfect and convenient for a tourist and you can fully take advantage of the public transportation. Literally, you can get to most of the spots in ten minutes. I will definitely recommend anyone who wants to visit Chicago to choose here to stay for a couple of days!",1.0
Chicago,"The location was fantastic. Easy walking distance to downtown, tourist attractions and public transport. It was ideal for the marathon, so close to the start/finish line. Anne’s communication was prompt and clear. It made things so easy. If I come back to Chicago again I wouldn’t hesitate to book this.",1.0
Chicago,"The room was great. It is convenient to many of the CTA sub lines and within walking distance to many tourists sites. the building and room itself is quiet. There is some outside noise that comes through, but that is usually the trade off one must be willing to deal with for downtown convenience.",1.0
Chicago,"My room in this amazing condo was really nice.  It was very clean and has a large closet. The sink has a counter and medicine cabinet for toiletries. The bed was comfy with a nice comforter, quality sheets, and lots of pillows (decorative and functional). There's an HDTV with HD antenna and Roku.   The living room has three very comfy chairs, a big screen TV with HD antenna and Roku in the living room, and a *printer.* There's also a nice table for meals with three chairs and a kitchen with granite counters and full-size appliances, completely stocked with cooking and eating basics.  There's even a full-service Starbucks downstairs!  Anne, the owner, is very responsive. She responded immediately and warmly to my messages about my arrival.  My room was hot the first night I came in, so I messaged her and asked if I could turn down the air conditioning temperature. Even though it was pretty late by then, she responded immediately, happily saying yes and telling me where the thermostat was. I was happy to see that the windows also open and have screens for fresh air. I opened them one night when it was cool and traffic noise was sometimes a bit loud when police went by with sirens, but didn't really bother me (YMMV). I asked about heat in the winter and was told the baseboard heater works well.   The only major downside for me was that I had to pay the high downtown daily parking fee because I drove there. But I later heard about an app that helps locate less expensive parking options:  (Website hidden by Airbnb)   Wishing you as happy and comfortable a stay as mine!",1.0
Chicago,Was in Chicago for a convention so Anne's place was close to Hilton where I could connect to meeting shuttle buses.  Individual bedrooms can be locked along with exterior door. Nice commons area with kitchen facilities. Numerous restraurants in area along with convenience store. Would definitely recommend Anne's place and will consider again in future. ,1.0
Chicago,"LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION!!! The apartment is within walking distance to many area attractions and close to lots of public transportation. The place is safe, clean, and spacious. Will definitely stay here again if visiting the city. Can’t beat the value for a prime location. ",1.0
Chicago,"Anne was great to work with, and we’d recommend her place to anyone! Just to be aware, it is an apartment with two separate bedrooms, and separate bathrooms, but shared living space, so you might run across another traveler- just so you aren’t surprised :)",1.0
Chicago,"My boyfriend Alex and I stayed in Anne's place for an extended weekend in Chicago (5/3-5/6) and it was exactly what we needed to get the most out of being there for such a short period of time. It was important to us to be in walking distance to downtown and only a transit ride away from other neighborhoods like Lincoln Park, Old Town, and Chinatown, and Anne's place was the perfect location for this. It was also very clean and Anne herself is an accommodating host who communicated with us quickly and efficiently. If possible, we would undoubtedly stay here again if/when we're back in Chicago!",1.0
Chicago,"Anne's apartment is a terrific value, and I would definitely stay there again (I've already recommended it to my sister, who's planning a trip). It's a lovely, spacious, beautifully decorated space in a great and safe location. Easy walk to the Art Institute, Millennium Park, etc. and a short walk to two ""L"" (subway) lines. My only issues concerned the overall air system. It turned out that the bedroom windows didn't open and since there was no ceiling fan or central fan, it felt airless with the door closed. I'm someone who's used to sleeping with an open window. Once I asked Anne about it the following night, she had helpful suggestions that resolved the problem.",1.0
Chicago,"So glad I got to stay with Anne on my trip to Chicago! I came out here for a conference and this was just the type of place I wanted to stay at: clean, easy, and close to the fun city things. My colleague and I never got to see super host Anne in person but she took good care of us with her excellent communication all throughout!",1.0
Chicago,"Very quiet apartment. There were others staying, but I couldn't tell it was very quiet. The bathroom is within the room, so  it's very private as well. The building is located a convenient distance from public transit , and it's not a bad walk to a lot of popular destinations such as Millennium Park, either. There's a bus stop literally right in front of the building. As for the apartment amenities, there was a good selection of shampoos and face washes, as well as liquid hand soap which I always miss at hotels! Plus in the bathroom, the usual hair dryer, & Plenty of closet space and hangers. This was a great value and I hope to stay here again.",1.0
Chicago,"This place was absolutely phenomenal! From the location, to Anne’s incredible hospitality, to the space itself - the room definitely can’t be beat. I would recommend this apartment to anyone who is traveling to Chicago!",1.0

Chicago,"I had a great stay at Anne's. She made check-in very simple. The location of the place was amazing, walking distance to many things and the place itself was very spacious and clean. Anne was always quick to answer any questions or concerns. I would highly recommend her!",1.0
Chicago,"Very nice apartment in a great location! Short walk to millenium park, the art institvte and the blue train to the airport. You may share the apartment with another airbnb guest, but Anne must do a very good screening, because the other guests I saw were very quiet and nice.",1.0
Chicago,"Anne's apartment ist perfectly situated for people who want to explore Chicago by foot or public transport - and yet you have a quiet place. I was surprised about the spacious room and storage facilities. I stayed for 9 days and could really ""move in"". The furniture ist not ""luxurious"", but functional and thought-out (table to work with a laptop... in bed :-)!). Anne replies to every mail within a short time - this was very helpful for my arrival which was postponed due to a cancelled flight. Very smooth check-in-and-out procedures. In fine: I'd stay with Anne again!",1.0
Chicago,This is a great location.. just a 2 minute walk to a metro that goes to all the tourist spots. Also for walkers you can find most of the stuff you want too. The place was clean and bed comfortable. This place is shared with other people other than the host which is different than what I am used to. ,1.0
Chicago,"You can expect to have a cozy and clean room to relax. You might be able to drop your luggage before check-in and after check-out, which I found it really helpful. The apartment was nice and comfortable so I enjoyed my stay most of the part. ",1.0
Chicago,"On my world trip I had nine days in Chicago to enjoy the summer, the music, the food and so on. Anne´s apartment was the perfect place to stay. Very near to the L and the buses, near to Grant Park and the other interesting places. I really enjoyed the time and Anne is a very helpful guest and the communication was perfect. Thank you Anne!!!",1.0
Chicago,This was a great room to stay in. Not only was it a lovely well decorated room the location was so good I pretty much walked everywhere as it was so central to a lot of Chicago’s main attractions. Anne was always quick to respond to emails and gave me loads of local knowledge before I had even left for the U.S. Will defo stay at Anne’s place again.,1.0
Chicago,"Check-in was without a problem - prior to my arrival, I received a detailed set of instructions. The apartment is, without a question, located in a great spot: two blocks away from Harrison (red line) and a couple of blocks from LaSalle or Jackson (both blue line), as well as the loop El station. [Travel from O'Hare is thus particularly easy.] There is a Starbucks and a 7/11 right next to the residence.   The room was clean and tidy; the bed was comfortable. The view onto Willis Tower was great, indeed. Anne was a great host who responded to questions within seconds; she provided detergent for laundry and gave helpful instructions (especially in light of being an int'l visitor).   Overall, a great experience; in particular for a business trip where you primarily need a centrally located, tidy, and comfortable space.",1.0
Chicago,"There were two of us on a baseball road trip. We wanted to see the White Sox at Comiskey & we did not want to spend a fortune. We found Michelle's  very large studio apt. It had a bad & futon. It was clean, quiet, private on a quiet street & reasonable.Michelle was very nice, showed us around. There was everything we needed, a TV , refrigerator & microwave. It was within walking distance if the L train, Comiskey  and close to the lake. We had a really good time & would stay there again",1.0
Chicago,Super clean and not far at all from downtown Chicago. She left a nice touch for our daughter and it was very spacious for a one bedroom style apartment. Check-in was easy an the steam room was perfect!  Great place and thanks Michelle. We will definitely go back if the opportunity arises.,1.0
Chicago,Michelle’s place was a fantastic outpost for us in our Chicago excursion. Michelle was a fabulous host and made us feel very welcome and had a wonderful space that was very tidy and well situated.  Our primary activity was a White Sox game and this place was wonderful for it (15 ish minute walk/5 min Uber).   If you are looking to visit the loop/downtown Chicago it is also great for this at only about a 15 min Uber to Navy Pier.,1.0
Chicago,Michelle is a very kind and sweet host. She has great communication and where her home is located it’s nice and quiet. The Uber/Lyft to the McCormick was very quick. Whenever we ran out of something or needed help she was always there. Great experience!,1.0
Chicago,"We stayed at this Airbnb for the American Beauty Hair Show at McCormick Place. Michelle was more than accommodating! She greeted us when we arrived with a tour of the apartment and some tips. The place was very clean and incredibly roomy. We used the steam room multiple times and it was so refreshing! This apartment is in walking distance from a large selection of food, grocery, and bus stops. I highly recommend!   *just a tip* Since this is an old building, there aren’t many outlets! I suggest bringing an extension cord.",1.0
Chicago,"I'm so glad we found Michelle's place for our stay in Chicago.  It was just what we needed for a relaxing weekend away.  The apartment was very clean, the bed was very comfortable, and there was plenty of storage for our luggage.

Chicago,Michelle’s place is as advertised. Very clean and her communication with guests is very prompt.   The place is located near a grocery store and a bus line that will take you to all the sites along Michigan Ave.   The steam room is great after a long day.,1.0
Chicago,I enjoyed my stay at Michelle’s place. The studio looked exactly like pictured. Michelle was there to greet me upon arrival to show me around and give a few tips and suggestions. Location was close to downtown via car and about a $14 Uber ride to downtown during the evening time. There was plenty of street parking. Bed and sofa were both comfortable and the place was clean. It was a great stay.,1.0
Chicago,"This is a great place for a stay in Chicago! Michelle is extremely hospitable, greeted us upon arrival and made us feel comfortable. The steam room was an added bonus! Easy to find with parking out front was ideal, and cheap Uber ride to downtown. Would definitely stay again!",1.0
Chicago,"Check in was straightforward and quick. Place was better than expected in that the steam room was amazing and the futon/couch was super comfy. Bed was warm and cozy with 4 pillows. The kitchenette was adequate (minifridge, microwave and cutlery/plates). You have to be ok with commuting a little into the city, but the bus is quite close, uber/lyft plentiful and metro station about a mile away (green line), though I would not walk this at night.  All in all a good experience.",1.0
Chicago,Michelle’s place is great! Good location and amenities. She is very accommodating and quick to respond to you with anything you could possibly need. Overall - this is a very nice place ran by a very kind and genuine owner that will make you feel welcome. Highly recommend,1.0
Chicago,"Michelle, is an outstanding host, attending to every little detail of a guest’s needs. This is a great accommodation with lots of amenities, including even a well functioning steam room! My favorite is easy/short walk to 31st/Marina beach, but it is also conveniently located relative to many attractions as noted.",1.0
Chicago,"Awesome, stylish studio.  Great location (half mile walk to the L, three stops away from downtown!), clean, cozy, everything we needed and more.  Bonus of being less than a mile jog/walk to the beautiful lakefront where we enjoyed a run Millennium park every morning.  Would stay here again in a heartbeat—Michelle could not have been more accommodating, thoughtful, responsive, and really went the extra mile to ensure we had a wonderful three days in the city.",1.0
Chicago,Michelle’s place was exactly as advertised and we did not run into any issues at all. Location was perfect being only two miles away from the venue we were going too.  Had an amazing time exploring Chicago.,1.0
Chicago,"Michelle was amazing!  It is a great Chicago-style getaway!  We ran a half marathon and used the steam room afterwards which couldn’t have been more perfect.  With free parking and near the train , we couldn’t have gotten a better stay for the price.  Will definitely try to stay at Michelle’s place again next year!!",1.0
Chicago,"The space is clean & wonderful. Close to all types of fast food and walgreens and a beauty supply I doubt that you’ll want for anything that you won’t be able to find within walking distance. the host Michelle couldn’t have been more hospitable. Most important for me though the space was VERY clean and I never once felt that ‘icky’ feeling of being in someone else’s space with someone else’s filth. The bed was comfy and there were waterbottles in the fridge when we had come home with food but nothing to drink! That was a lifesaver. Although I was unable to get in the steamroom, my buddy did and said that the experience in the sizable sit down shower/steamroom was superb. He especially liked the eucalyptus drops she left for the aromatherapy experience! This was my first airbnb experience and Michelle has set the bar high for all that are to follow. She met us at around 2pm for check in and explained the rules of the land but there were also instructions laid out on a clipboard as a reference for the operation of the steamroom and other necessary information. Michelle was very welcoming and an affable host and  picked up every phone and answered every text very promptly. She even allowed us a check out an hour later than agreed upon! I must say that I recommend this airbnb to ANY party of 3 or less (due to there just being a bed and a futon) looking for value, cleanliness, peace of mind and convenience within the Chicago area. Thanks Michelle!",1.0
Chicago,"Anyone new to Chicago must understand that Bronzeville holds a very special history. Having lived there several years ago it’s always held a very special place in my heart. Mrs. Michelle’s place is ideal for the traveler who wants to be in the “city” but still experience the comforts of suburban life such as ample parking and warm neighbors. My fiancée and his brother stayed in her basement suite, which boasts a sauna! The place smelled wonderful and was remarkably clean. The host was easily available via phone and responded to my messages right away. She was very pleasant and easy to talk to. This place is often booked, which is no surprise. Lastly, the Green line, Mariano’s and several restaurants, including the wonderful Yassa’s, is within walking distance. ",1.0
Chicago,"This was me and my boyfriend’s first experience with AirBnb, and Michelle made it great for us! She instantly made us feel welcome when we arrived, and provided a comfy place for us to stay. Brochures and other information about Chicago were left out, along with some water bottles and snacks. The steam room is very relaxing to take a shower in. We took a Lyft into downtown both days we were there, and it was very reasonable and quick from her place. Definitely would recommend staying here!",1.0
Chicago,"Michelle's place was just what we needed or a 3 day business trip to Chicago.  Her description and photos are spot on.  We enjoyed the location (close to the White Sox, McCormick Place, and the city bus).  The neighborhood is tree lined and filled with great architecture.  We parked on the street and used the bus to get around.  Michelle had water bottles in the fridge and a few snacks along with visitor brochures and maps of the area.  The space came with a portable a/c unit and dehumidifier that worked well.    Thank you.",1.0

Easily ubered all over where we needed to go, roughly 15 to 20 minutes away from everything, only because of the congested traffic which is to be expected. Was greeted as soon as we arrived and unless we asked a question we were not bothered by Michelle and Ray our entire stay. Quick responses and helpful with travel. Would definitely come back!",1.0
Chicago,Super place. Particular when you attending a conference at he McCormick place. Either one stop by train or just a 15 minute walk.

A pearl in good distance from busy downtown.,1.0
Chicago,our stay at Michelle's was perfect.  A nice quiet neighborhood easily accessible by public transport or Uber.

Chicago,Staying  at Aaron's was a treat! The building is secure and beautiful and wonderfully located. The apartment was perfectly clean and very well decorated. Check in/out was easy and the amenities of the apartment were fantastic!

Aaron was very easy to communicate with and I'd absolutely stay there again!,1.0
Chicago,Aaron’s place is a wonderful spot to stay on a short trip to Chicago. It is right in the middle of a ton of really good restaurants and just blocks from the lake and red line. The place was spotless and I felt right at home as soon as I came in. Overall it is a wonderful spot to stay and I would definitely stay there again if I visited Chicago again in the near future!,1.0
Chicago,"This space was perfect for a weekend getaway in Chicago. A few blocks from the red line made transportation a breeze. The apartment has great amenities, a wonderful common space in the lobby, which includes a bar, coffee shop, and diner.

Could not have asked for a better first visit to Chicago. The red line is just two blocks away and since we had friends close by we had no trouble traveling by train to see them. Aaron was always a message away if we had any questions. Already planning my next trip and would love to stay here again. Do not hesitate to stay here you’ll love it, trust me!",1.0
Chicago,"This was my boyfriend and I’s first Air Bnb experience and we loved it! This place was exactly as shown in the pictures! The check in was pretty simplistic (however try to avoid the neighbor with the angry dog). At first we struggled hard to find parking but Aaron’s instructions on parking are pretty clear and very helpful. The streets can be hard to find spots on so I recommend leaving your car somewhere if you get a spot and then taking advantage of the train and bus system which is very close to Aaron’s place and convenient! When you get into the hotel, I’d recommend checking out all of the extra amenities offered such as the pool and especially the rooftop deck. The bedroom was very nice and the kitchen, and living room as well but my favorite thing about the place was the bathroom (specifically how comfortable the shower is). Although, we had not met Aaron, he was always available when needed and was pretty clear with the instructions. Also, the apartment is near many places that you explore. I’d recommend Vietnamese town (tank noodles is always my #1 spot) and try not to park in 975 W Wilson Ave if you can’t find a parking spot, we booked it using SpotHero and had many complications. Overall, it was an unforgettable experience and we had a wonderful time! We will definitely book this place again if we visit Chicago!",1.0

I not only want to come back to visit - I want to movie in! Aaron's communication was excellent and he made check in very easy. ",1.0
Chicago,"Aaron's place in the Uptown area of Chicago was a fantastic place to stay. The apartment itself was well set-up and well stocked with towels, linens, and kitchen wares. The building's amenities are very nice; we made use of the spacious roof deck, the ""backyard"" area, as well as the wonderful pool in the basement. The lobby offered a good area to meet people as well as a places to sit and tables (with outlets) for working. We were able to grab the Red Line, only a few blocks walk, and were downtown quite quickly. It was also a quick drive up to Andersonville, one of favorite northern Chicago  neighborhoods. Aaron's nice touches include a guidebook for the apartment and the building as well as parking info for the area and even shopping bags (Chicago, like some other major cities, is trying to do away with plastic bags). We will hopefully be return here again soon!",1.0
Chicago,"absolute best location and digs for a trip to Chicago. my wife and I loved the apartment -- cozy, immaculate, chock full of amenities -- as well as the neighborhood. Aaron is a perfect host, we highly recommend staying at Lawrence House.",1.0

Chicago,"We had a great stay at Aaron’s!  The location is perfect for the Red Line, easy to get downtown and the neighborhood itself is a great walking location, with fabulous food options and perfect for going to a Cubs game.  We stayed 6 nights and slept great the whole visit.  The place was very comfortable and the rooftop deck was a great place to hang out at dusk.  ",1.0
Chicago,"My husband and I needed some respite in Chicago for our wedding weekend and Aaron’s apartment was exactly what we hoped for!   The apartment itself is stylish and clean  and was the perfect place for me and my girls to get our hair and makeup done. What really sets this place apart from the rest are the amenities available. Aaron’s apartment building is architecturally stunning. It seems to have been modernized with a large open lobby with a bar, cafe, and lounge area.   You definitely have to check out the rooftop. The views are unbeatable and there are tons of places to lounge around. Since we had a busy weekend, we unfortunately couldn’t take advantage of all the amenities this place has to offer. Wish we could have stayed longer to enjoy it all and maybe next time we will!  Thanks, Aaron!",1.0
Chicago,"Great Location, Amazing Amenities and Perfectly Priced. If your a savvy traveler like myself finding the best place in a great location with amenities is necessary. Aaron’s place in the up town of Chicago exceeded all my expectations. Clean, chic and full of all of the amenities required to make a trip to CHI great. The loft was a great home away from home with grocery stores nearby and close to public transportation or quick drive down the shore to the city. For a family of four the pool was a great bonus! Aaron was responsive, prompt and a thoughtful host providing us with detailed instructions on how to get to the place as well as tips for everything from parking to places to dine! We are sure to stay again! The space was plenty large enough for 4-6 people! So if you’re looking for a great get away in the right location with a wonderful host - look no further! ",1.0

Chicago,"Aaron’s flat is perfect for two or three people. Nicely appointed and stylish. There is lots of free parking around his building, we had no trouble finding a spot in early April. Many good restaurants within walking distance and only about a block away from the “El’s” red line Lawrence station. If you want to get into the city, take the red line toward Dan Ryan/95th and get off at Chicago St. This is the best and most economical way to get around in Chicago. Try to avoid rush hour through the week if possible. Because the flat is located in a highly populated area, I recommend bringing ear plugs if you’re a light sleeper. Ambulances and trash trucks run day and night. Take advantage of the pool and work out facilities in the building. Both are top notch and not crowded. Be sure to check out the rooftop lounge too. We were able to stream Netflix on both TV’s in the flat and the antenna will get you about 25 local stations. We did need to reset the router several times during our stay, as the WiFi service is a bit spotty. I would highly recommend Aaron’s place, we will definitely stay there again.  Tracy G.   Columbus, Ohio",1.0

Perfect place to spend a long weekend.",1.0
Chicago,"I loved this listing. From check-in to check-out, it was easy. The cafe downstairs was a great way to jumpstart our mornings. My boyfriend went to the gym downstairs, while I enjoyed the coziness of lounging around in the living room. There are many little restaurants within walking distance. The rooftop deck is worth checking out too. We went at night and the view was beautiful, especially with all the snow.   My boyfriend and I had minimal interaction with the host, Aaron, but he’s easily accessible. Really nice guy and genuine when we spoke on our last day!",1.0
Chicago,"Aaron's place is perfect for a couple,  or a couple and a child.   We like it because we visit our children in Lakeview, so it's close to them.

Chicago,"Aaron's place is super stylish and the building it is housed in is top-notch.  I made use of the coffee shop, the bar (Larry's), and the workout facility.  If I stay again, I'll certainly utilize the swimming pool.  There is plenty of open lounge and work space in the lobby and feels like a cross between a grand hotel and a co-working space.

We also enjoyed walking around the neighborhood and visiting some Mexican restaurants.",1.0
Chicago,Awesomely amazing.  The hospitality was undesirable.  Easy check-in easy check-out.  Zero problems zero headache zero worries.  Extremely clean and beautiful place.

Chicago,"Guadalupe was very welcoming , the house is actually much nicer in person , great decor very homely feel. There’s TV’s all over the house and mirrors ! The balconies are beautiful.

Chicago,"Guadalupe was such a great host! She was really helpful, she always replied very fast and she even bought groceries for us!  The AirBnB itself was beautiful! It was an entire house with 2 floors, everything nicely decorated and absolutely clean. We really enjoyed our time there!  It is located in a mexican neighborhood, which was really safe and gave a feeling of holiday as we were often surrounded by mexican music while eating outside in the beautiful garden.  With Uber, it takes you about 15-20 minutes into the city for a price of about 16$.   All in all, I absolutely recommend Guadalupe‘s AirBnB and if I return, I would definitely book it again!",1.0
Chicago,"We had a fantastic stay at Guadalupe's place and we would always come back! The house is very pretty and clean. Moreover, it has everything you need to cook yourself a meal.

Her hopitality was the best we've experienced in Chicago! I won't hesitate to stay here again. Thank you",1.0
Chicago,This place was really nice and just what we were looking for. We travelled from the UK this was our first stop off although we were quite away from Downtown it was easy to get there.

Chicago,"This was my second stay at Ellie’s place, and I maintain that it’s one of the best Airbnbs ever! So quiet, clean, stylish, and comfortable. The tub is awesome and the coffee’s great, what more could I ask for?",1.0
Chicago,"Place was great! Clean, cozy, great location. Check in & out went seamlessly. LOVED the bathtub and shower. I would definitely recommend.

Loved it!",1.0
Chicago,"As a single traveler the studio set up was perfect for me. The location was great, since I had just been staying downtown at a conference prior to my stay it was nice to get out a bit and see some other neighborhoods. I could easily walk to the 606 Trail - which I really enjoyed - and N Milwaukee Ave for some fun shopping. I appreciated the guide they had in the studio with local recommendations listed, I got take-out from the Indian place down the street and it was delicious. Very comfortable bed!",1.0

It was the perfect size and had everything I needed. The style of the whole place was gorgeous. I can tell a lot of thought went into creating this space. The shower and bathtub were amazing, and it was very helpful that there was a hair dryer, shampoo/conditioner, body wash, etc. When I do get the chance to travel to Chicago again I hope this is available.

The little touches, such as welcome beers, pour over coffee, books on Chicago, and available toilet trees (we flew in and only had carry-one) were perfect.

Chicago,"If I had more a sense of self-interest, I would write the  worst review ever so that this amazing space is always available for me when I'm in Chicago. First: it is it's own little building in the city. Wow! It's designed so beautifully, I took tons of photos to inspire my guest house back in CT. Elinor was responsive, accommodating, and super nice. I'm spreading the word to all of my friends who are jazzed staying there. The location is 10-12 minutes from downtown... well worth it for these gorgeous accommodations. BTW: the photos don't really capture the details and inviting sweetness of the place. I'll see you again, Elinor!",1.0
Chicago,"Ellie and Devin's space is charming! It's a well-designed, well-maintained large studio with incredibly thoughtful touches: books about the history of Chicago, more books from Chicago based writers and poets, games, postcards, and even stamps. I was a little nervous the first night with the studio being so close to the street, but I slept like a dream – the bed is comfortable and the studio is airy and bright. The place is exactly as pictured, even better. Ellie and Devin were very responsive and helpful. I would definitely come back and highly recommend staying here.",1.0

Basically I’m sad I can’t just move and stay in forever. People always say, “oh I’ll be back” but this is serious, I can’t wait to book again!

It was the perfect space for a quick getaway to Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"Amazing and beautiful first airbnb experience. The place was decorated very modern and was clean. Both the walk in shower and claw-foot tub were great and the water got very hot.

There were also nice personal touches such as food recommendations and stocked beverages in the fridge (water filter, coffee, and some wine). Me and my boyfriend had an amazing time.",1.0
Chicago,"Wonderful place to stay while visiting the windy city of Chicago! Not far from great restaurant, bars, shopping and downtown.

Highly recommend a stay at this location.",1.0

Chicago,Ellie’s place is exactly what you see in the all - no false advertising. It’s very light and open and she maximizes the space greatly. She’s very easy to communicate with. The Damen & Western L stations are close enough walk which we utilized a lot. Would definitely stay here again!,1.0

Chicago,"There is a reason so many reviews start with how stylish the place is. That reason is because it is stunning and just as advertised! The level of detail and thought put in to the design is unbelievable.   Location is great, quick walk to the blue line. Check in/out is super easy, and the studio manual made our interactions minimal.   Great place to stay, will absolutely repeat.   Thanks again!",1.0
Chicago,"This place was great. It's worth the price just to swim around in that huge bathtub. Ellie was a great host, and the apartment had everything you could need for a great time in Chicago. I found most places I needed to go (food, cute shops, metro) to be about a ~10 min walk away, which I don't mind because I love to walk, but if you don't consider getting a car. It was really easy to get to downtown using the train. I have no complaints, this was an awesome  place!",1.0
Chicago,"This is such a cute, clean and comfortable space! I could stay here for weeks! Nice little neighborhood. Had initially worried about noise at night, but it did quiet down for a restful evening.  The fresh ground coffee, sodas, beer help to make it comfortable. Nice distance from downtown. Safe to run in the mornings with a park nearby. Love this place!",1.0
Chicago,"Ellie’s studio is absolutely stunning! She goes above & beyond for her guest! There are loads of local nicknacks laying around the studio to indulge into. She has her cabinets stocked with things one might need (ibuprofen, cotton swabs, razors, etc). The neighbor hood is very nice. There are not many of taxi’s in the area, so if you don’t drive one might want to download uber. Definitely worth the stay! Would definitely come back!",1.0
Chicago,"Fantastic stay! The studio was as pristine as pictured. You felt more like you were staying in a hotel than someone's home. Great amenities like shampoo, soft towels and even yoga mats! Would highly recommend,",1.0
Chicago,"Elinor's studio was a magical place, and I could tell as I soon as I stepped up to the door, because care was taken in styling the exterior with little faerie lights that sparkled. I hate to say this, but I can be a bit of snob when it comes aesthetic and decor. I have not one complaint about this studio. I was absolutely blown away. The incredible level of detail and design, even down to the studio's handbook was meticulous and thought out.  What's even more wonderful is the central location to all the haunts in the Bucktown/Wicker Park area. I drove and literally everywhere I went was less than a 10 minutes away. I can't imagine that taking public transportation would take any longer. If you do drive, Elinor provides a parking permit, which gives you the freedom to park anywhere in the vivinity without the fear of getting a ticket.  By far Elinor's place is one of the best spots I've stayed in for Air BnB. If you're looking for something magical and romantic (oh, I forgot to mention there's wonderfully restored claw-foot Victorian bath tub) look no further.",1.0
Chicago,Stayed here while visiting Chicago. The apartment was really clean and cozy and located in a really good location for our trip. We were able to park right out front for our stay and walk everywhere. If you're looking to spend time in the Ukrainian Village i would recommend staying here. Close to the train if ya want to travel other places too.,1.0
Chicago,"The initial observation of the space was of course a stylish space for a reasonable price.  Seeing the space in person is such an enjoyable experience - especially when noticing all the fine details not revealed in the online pics.  It is in those details that raises the level of impression and sets it apart from other spaces.    Elinor and I had minimal contact, but that was because instructions were clear on the check-in and check-out procedures, where to park, and even how to make the coffee - which we were thoroughly confused at first.    I enjoy exploring different places to stay when visiting areas, but I would consider staying here again on my next trip to Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"I enjoyed my stay at Elinor's studio apartment in Wicker Park.  The location was pefect for me.  The studio was quite stylish and had many personal touches, including a studio manual which I found quite helpful and fun.  I really appreciated the 2 bottles of wine and the beer selection in the fridge.  The kitchen was minimal but that was fine with me because I planned to enjoy Chicago's dining scene.  The bed was  very confortable, which was a definite plus.  The heater was somewhat louder than I was expecting, but that is the only concern I had.  I would definitely stay here again.",1.0
Chicago,"This is a great spot. Located near hip Wicker Park and related. Quiet, good access to Metro and very pleasant spot to hang out and do some work too. Hostess was very helpful on restaurants etc . This is a top BnB!!!",1.0
Chicago,"The space is exactly as described. Gorgeous. The bathroom is stylish, clean, and the shower is great. Would love to have a space like that in my own home tbh. They have cute touches throughout the studio, including Where Chefs Eat (I have that at home too!) and Studs Terkel's ""Working"" in the bathroom. The bed was really comfortable and once we figured out how to configure the NEST properly for our purposes, the temperature control was on point. One minor note is that both heat and cool air come out predominantly at the head of the bed, and it could be bothersome to people who are sensitive to dry air. My wife had to turn to the foot of the bed one night because she's super sensitive, but it didn't bother me much. The location was good for me because I don't need to be right downtown and don't mind taking a Lyft everywhere, plus I like to be in ""real"" neighborhoods. Puerto Rican restaurants abound as well as cool street art, if you care to venture around. It's about a twenty minute drive to many downtown area attractions. The hosts were very accommodating to my needs, as I had to cancel one day due to a family emergency. They were very easy to work with throughout. Will definitely look to return here my next stay in Chicago",1.0
Chicago,Elinor's place is close to perfect. Every corner of the space is thoughtfully detailed and styled. It's located very centrally to Logan Square and the Bucktown/Wicker Park area and I enjoyed walking the neighborhood in my downtime. Her communication was clear and extremely quick and I truly cannot say enough about how pleasant my stay was. Highly recommended.,1.0
Chicago,"Before I arrived, I loved the photos and thought the place would be perfect for my stay over New Year's. Walking in, it was somehow even better. From the furniture to the lighting to the tableware, everything in the space is very intentionally curated. I have a feeling the owners are designers; the whole place has a great aesthetic while still being comfortable. One of my favorite places I've stayed so far",1.0
Chicago,"We had a great stay at this charming, stylish studio. Clean digs and thoughtful touches like coffee, beer, and wine were lovely. Location was perfect for getting around town by foot or Lyft, yet the street itself was quiet and residential. Great host communication and simple check in and check out. Would stay again in a heartbeat!",1.0
Chicago,"I love this spot . The layout, decor and vibe are definitely hip. Everything is so easy + the communication with Elinor is on point. The amenities are great . The experience is very hommie , every time you discover little details that make a difference in your stay.   If you’re looking for something local, not loud ,  away from tourists this is definitely a good location.",1.0
Chicago,"Ellie’s place is so so wonderful! Chic, stylish, beautiful location from which you can easily access the trendiest Chicago area, Wicker Park. Ellie responds in mere minutes should you need anything and the keypad entry makes it so easy to come and go as you please, no need for keys! 10/10 would recommend and hope to stay here again! ❤️",1.0
Chicago,"Beautiful decor with so much space! Instructions for checkin were easy to follow. The coffee and extras were great!  Very comfortable bed! The apartment has an urban ambiance. Jeremy provided parking passes and we were able to find parking a block away. Communication was excellent. Jeremy answered any questions I had almost immediately. Neighborhood had a safe feel. We walked to local restaurants close by. One unfortunate thing, which was no fault of our host- when we went to leave, we discoveredthat our catalytic converter was stolen off of our car. I had driven our older SUV since I knew it would be parked for several days. Turns out, these are easiervehicles to get under and cut. I would not hesitate to stay here again.",1.0
Chicago,"This Airbnb is the best! Location and space are the key highlights! Jeremy has great design taste! Close to the train and many restaurants. We would definitely stay here again! If you’re visiting, try the rolled ice cream across the street! We had it twice!",1.0
Chicago,"The apartment was absolutely fantastic and everything was as good as advertised. The entire unit was much more spacious than it appeared in the photos which was a welcomed surprise as I have stayed in several Airbnb's that were smaller than photographed.   You could not ask for a better location, one block from the blue line which made traveling to/from O'Hare and into downtown a breeze. You're also within walking distance to countless top notch restaurants and shops.  Jeremy was a very responsive and accommodating host and he really made us feel taken care of when we had some flight plan changes. I would recommend this apartment to anyone wanting to visit Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"There is much to like about this apartment.  It's spacious, has full amenities, plenty of character, parking is included, and the place is clean.  Wicker Park is growing, has a unique vibe, feels safe, and offers options within walking distance for groceries.  The area also has many choices for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and drinks.  We chose to use the kitchen for breakfast, and the waffle maker was a great perk.  A critical factor in comfort, rest and relaxation is the bed.  While clean, we found the mattress to be uncomfortable.  It currently presents itself as firm and lumpy with indentations and sag from years of use.  Upgrading this one very important item would make this location, apartment, and experience worth renting again.  We enjoyed our stay overall and will keep this as an option in the future.",1.0
Chicago,"Came to Chicago for my cousin's birthday party. It was in my old neighborhood, so I felt very much at home. The place was spacious and exactly how it was described! I briefly meet Jeremy when I arrived, he was extremely nice. Would love to come back here when I visit Chicago again.",1.0
Chicago,"I loved this loft and everything about it.  The location was great - 1.5 blocks from the CTA - we were able to explore the entire city using public transportation.  Check in and check out were a breeze.  Jeremy was kind and offered great suggestions when we met briefly during the stay.  The apartment was spotlessly clean, comfortable, quiet and well appointed.  This was my first visit to Chicago and I would gladly stay here on my next trip.",1.0
Chicago,"We loved this place. It's spacious and very convenient. If you have small children, you may want to know that there is a firehouse nearby, but it did not bother us, we expected city noises. There's a Metro station barely a block away. It's great to have a washer and dryer right in the apartment since we tend to pack very lightly. We greatly appreciated the neighborhood parking stickers Jeremey provided and we easily found parking about 1 block away on a safe, residential street. We'll stay here again next time we're in town.",1.0
Chicago,"This is a large, 1 bedroom apartment within 2 blocks of the blue line. Very convenient! There’s a well equipped full kitchen with a small grocery across the street. Of course there a numerous great restaurants in the area so there’s no need to cook. The apartment was very comfortable and clean. We had plenty of pillows, blankets, towels etc. which was much appreciated.",1.0
Chicago,"This was my very first AirBnB and if all of them are like this one, I'll never stay in a hotel again. Jeremey's communication was excellent from start to finish and his home is so beautiful and immaculate. It is easy to find and right off the blue line. The home had EVERYTHING I needed and then some. He even left me 2 day parking passes for the area which made people coming by easy to park nearby. It is in a very cool neighborhood and as a single woman staying in an area I've never been, I felt very safe. When I visit again, I would definitely stay there again.",1.0
Chicago,Jeremey is a wonderful host and his place is extremely nice. He is quick to respond with any questions and is willing to give recommendations around the city. The place was clean and decorated with care. It has everything you would need during your stay.,1.0
Chicago,"Jeremy's apartment is exactly as advertised - stylish, large, comfortable and spotlessly clean in a very safe, hip neighborhood.  The kitchen has all you would need to fix your own meals.  We, however, opted to take advantage of the multitude of excellent bars, coffee shops and restaurants within very easy walking distance on Division Street and North Milwaukee Avenue (for lovers of high quality Nepalese / Indian food we recommend Cumin on North Milwaukee). Communication with Jeremy was very easy.  If and when we return to this part of Chicago Wicker we would, without hesitation choose to stay in Jeremy's place.",1.0
Chicago,"We were very pleased with the apartment. With an updated modern kitchen and bathroom we had everything we needed to be comfortable. Jeremy was a great host, communicated all details we needed when needed.",1.0
Chicago,Jeremy's place was fantastic! It is really big. Was great to unpack and have space and feel at home. Really close to the blue line. Easy to get anywhere. Felt safe in the neighborhood. Fire station next door but never bothered us or woke us up. Would definitely stay again!,1.0
Chicago,Our stay was great! Jeremey was very responsive when we asked him about accommodating our two dogs during the stay. There was even a small crate provided that we ended up using for the smaller pup. Everything was just as described and the apartment is close to many great restaurants and shops. We'd stay again! :),1.0
Chicago,"Jeremey's place is fantastic -- it's bigger than we were expecting and has a really nice overall feel to it.  It's nicely decorated and has all the amenities you would need.  Jeremey was very quick to respond to messages and helped out if anything at all was needed.  Check-in was simple and the building felt secure.  It's just a couple minutes' walk to the blue line, which brings you right into downtown in about 10 minutes.  Also close to some cool spots on N Milwaukee, like Oiistar, the amazing ramen place.  Super nice experience and we'd definitely stay with Jeremey again!",1.0
Chicago,"This was perfect for our needs.  Everything was as advertised.  It's a beautiful space and the location is great.  (Ashland itself is not too appealing but you're a one-minute walk from blue line, can stroll west on Division or walk up Milwaukee Ave to Bucktown.).  Self-checkin was super easy and we had everything we needed.",1.0
Chicago,"Jeremy was very responsive, answering all questions quickly and thoroughly.  His place was nice and very clean.  My parents stayed at the Air BnB to visit me and were quite pleased.  Being that I own and live in downtown Chicago, I can say that this location fantastic and the price to be a great value.",1.0
Chicago,This place is one of the nicest accommodations I have ever stayed at. Yes the price is expensive compared to a hotel but if you want a solid night's sleep and little slice of home be sure to check out Jeremy's place!,1.0
Chicago,Wonderful place.  We really enjoyed ourselves and relaxed at Jeremey's loft.  Very clean.  We enjoyed being able to watch people on the streets from the loft.  Love the mixture of cultures which we don't get much of back home.  Location was great.  Very quick walk to get to Wicker Park and many great local restaurants as well.  Felt very safe in the neighborhood and at Jeremey's place.  Super nice people.  Jeremey is fantastic at returning messages.  Always a quick reply and we had no problems at all that couldn't be fixed quickly.  Highly recommend Jeremey's loft!,1.0
Chicago,"Jeremey's apartment far exceeded our expectations.  The pictures don't do justice to how beautiful, stylish and very spacious this place is, not to mention comfortable and clean.  Everything was simply perfect.  Every possible amenity to make you feel right at home--we wanted for nothing.  Comfortable bed and couches, beautiful, roomy bathroom with large shower and plenty of hot water, fully stocked kitchen, excellent wi-fi and incredibly easy check-in process. We loved the location, merely 2 short blocks (roughly 3 min) walk to the Blue line on the L/ subway.  So easy to get to the main attractions downtown, but also in a great spot to explore the Wicker Park/ West Town neighborhoods and all the great restaurants and shops.  An excellent Airbnb experience--Thank you, Jeremey!!",1.0
Chicago,We found it exactly as advertised—perhaps even better. Super accommodations in a great location. Jeremey was very accessible and promptly responded to our requests and questions. We look forward to staying there again on our next trip to Chicago.,1.0
Chicago,We LOVED the location. The area seemed very safe and was central to the blue line and a Divvy bike station. (Tip: take the blue line to and from O’hare to save a lot of money on transportation) The apartment was very roomy and we enjoyed having access to a kitchen. Something to note is the TV does not have cable or “smart” access. We ended up buying a firestick so we had something to watch while winding down at the end of our days. Jeremy was quick to respond any time we had questions or needed anything! Thank you for a great stay!,1.0
Chicago,"Better than it looked online, a beautiful space with everything needed and then some. Great location, close to public transportation and wonderful local spots. Jeremy was attentive and helpful with all of my queries. Would stay here whenever I’m in Chicago. Can’t recom enough!",1.0
Chicago,"This is a beautiful unit in a great neighborhood in Chicago.  Jeremy was a great host and was easy to communicate with.  Check-in and check-out were a breeze and the apartment was spotless.  It's on a busy street but there was very little noise.  The blue line is a block away as are Target, CVS and a bunch of great coffee shops and places to eat.  Also super easy to pick up a cab or an Uber/Lyft.  Would recommend this place without hesitation!",1.0
Chicago,Communication was fast and easy and Jeremey was available every step of the way.    Apartment was better than I expected.  Great location and very close to the Blue Line which can get you just about anywhere.     Would absolutely recommend and would stay here again in the future.   ,1.0
Chicago,"This is a spacious apartment and very nicely furnished. The location is just a few minutes walk from the blue line with quick transportation direct to the heart of downtown. Check-in was easy and the host provided a sheet with lots of helpful suggestions for local eating places, of which there are many.  Staying at Jeremey's place for 4 nights provided a very comfortable place to stay for our tired bodies after spending our days exploring Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,Jeremey’s place is very spacious and clean.  It has everything you need for a short or long term stay.  Jeremey is very nice and answers any question very promptly.  The location is also very convenient for travel on public transport.  Highly recommended!,1.0
Chicago,"Couldn't have asked for a better place. It was super easy to get to and from both town and O'Hare, with a Blue Line stop only one block away. It was beautiful and cheerful as well. Loved the full kitchen and nice extra-large tub. Jeremey was a lovely host. I wish we could have stayed even longer!",1.0
Chicago,"Great location with convenient transportation. The neighborhood has a cool vibe. As a vinyl record collector, I was excited about being across the street from Dusty Groove and close to Reckless Records. Great overall experience.",1.0
Chicago,"My wife and I spent 2 nights at Jeremey's place. While pictures can often be deceiving, we were pleasantly surprised at how large and open the apartment was in person. It was perfect. Jeremey was traveling in Spain at the time, but he was quick to respond to questions we had the day of and during the trip about things such as checking in and adjusting the nest thermostat. We'd happily stay there again.",1.0
Chicago,Great space in a convenient location—a vibrant neighborhood and just a block from blue line. The apartment has a good vibe and personality and is very clean. Jeremy was attentive and responsive. I’ll go back.,1.0
Chicago,"Jeremey's apartment is really great. It's large and bright in all the right places (and quieter and darker in the bedroom, which is lovely for sleeping), stylishly decorated (without being overdone--the decor fits the urban space perfectly), has a fantastic shower, everything you need for a comfortable stay and is in one of my favorite Chicago neighborhoods, with a bajiggety restaurants, bars, shops, etc. The provided parking passes are super helpful, especially for weekend stays, because parking in this part of the city is no joke (in fact, if you can manage without a car, do, because you won't need it once you're here--everything is walkable, lyft/uber is plentiful and the El train is literally right there.)  If mobility is an issue for you, you should know that you have to walk up a flight of steep, narrow stairs to get to the apartment. Also, it's really in the real city, and real cities generally aren't that quiet, so if you're a super sensitive sleeper who needs deep, dark silence, you'll maybe want to bring ear plugs and/or a sleep mask.   But otherwise, I completely recommend this place. Jeremey is a kind, helpful and responsive host, the apartment is so lovely, and it's a really great value for Chicago, too.",1.0
Chicago,"We enjoyed our stay at Jeremy’s place. It's conveniently located, about 15 minutes to the loop and 20 minutes to Midway airport. Although we got around with Uber, the blue line is just minutes across the street. The apartment is super clean and lovely decorated. Jeremy is very thoughtful with the travel guide and tips. It was great to meet a Cal alumni at Chicago. =) I would recommend this listing to everyone.",1.0
Chicago,"This home was great. Jeremey provided easy check in details and instructions. The location was great because I was close to everything downtown and many shops and stores. I recommend this home and would certainly stay here again. Thanks again, Jeremey!",1.0
Chicago,"Jeremy was easily accessible for any questions via text and he even checked in the second day to make sure everything was okay. The apartment spacious, comfortable and centrally located. Just a few steps to the blue line CTA train, restaurants and shops. The neighborhood is busy so the provided parking permits were a huge plus.",1.0
Chicago,"This space is amazing. Plenty of room, furnishings are great, kitchen has everything you could need, and the shower was perfect after a long day of exploring Chicago in the cold. Jeremey was prompt with responses and great about giving me tips on places to check out. Literally just a few steps away from the Blue Line which made getting around the city super easy. I will definitely be looking to get this place again next time I am in Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"Great place! We stayed there with our 18month during our summer holiday trip, all three of us loved Jeremey’s place. Bigger than expected. Jeremey was very supportive and fast with all kind of questions. We can highly recommend this place, also when you are traveling with small children.",1.0
Chicago,"What a great stay in Chicago!!! Jeremey‘s loft is perfectly situated in one of our favourite areas within Chicago. There are so many things to explore in walking distance: restaurants, shopping, parks, and the great 606 trail. The train („L“, blue line) - which is more or less directly in front of the apartment - connects you directly with downtown as well as with the airport. The apartment is so cool, we would love to live there! Despite the busy street in front of the house the apartments inside is so quiet and we slept like babies. Jeremey is a fantastic host and helped us a lot to find our ways, gave us great recommendations and answered immediately whenever we wrote a message. We will definitely come again!!!",1.0
Chicago,"A very spacious and spotlessly clean apartment, it holds special charm with bare brick walls and wooden floors with plenty of seating and a very large bed with a well equipped dressing room.  The bathroom is great with a very impressive bath for easing away the muscles after a long day of exploring.  We didn’t use the kitchen much apart from making a hot drink as we ate out most of the time but there is a great health food shop just opposite and a food shop just by the subway station.  Although we didn’t get to meet Jeremey his communication with us was superb.",1.0
Chicago,"Jeremy’s place is amazing, not only is it huge, it has everything you need for a comfortable stay, it’s in a great location for getting around town (literally one minute walk from the blue line at Division), and really easy to get to on the blue line from O’hare airport.  Jeremy was a fantastic host, very quick to respond to any queries we had, and was kind enough to let us leave our bags for a couple of hours while we went for brunch before heading back to the airport.  I would highly recommend his apartment to anyone wanting to explore Chicago.",1.0

Chicago,"Jeremey’s place is so beautiful, a perfect loft you could imagine with a view to a quiet street. It has lots of light, in the morning or in the evening too.

Chicago,Beautiful apartment thats is decorated to perfection. Its conveniently located (10 min walk to wicker park and 20 min subway to downtown). Jeremy was very accommodating and his local coffee & donut tips were great!,1.0
Chicago,"Rob’s place was beautiful! It looked exactly as advertised. The apartment was spacious & stylishly decorated. Lots of restaurants & bars within walking distance, as well as a grocery store. Rob was super responsive & hospitable. We were not able to check in before 3, but he allowed us to leave our luggage in his store prior to check in & even took it upstairs to the apartment for us! The only downside was that the bedroom can get a little warm, especially on a hot summer day. Other than that, we fully enjoyed our stay. Would definitely stay here again!",1.0
Chicago,"Rob’s Place was beautifully furnished and decorated. It was also only a 3 minute walk from the nearest bus stop which can take you to downtown or any of the metro/L lines - very convenient. The only downside is that there is no air conditioning in the bedroom so it got really hot. It is also on the 3rd floor so that’s something to consider if you don’t like taking the stairs. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and would recommend it!",1.0
Chicago,Rob's place is immaculate! I have never seen an Airbnb so tastefully decorated and cozy. Its in the middle of a bustling restaurant and shopping district but is surprisingly quiet. Rob himself was very responsive and a great host. I would definitely come back here for sure. Make sure you take advantage of the $20/day parking that Rob offers. It was a lifesaver.,1.0
Chicago,"My experience could not have been better. This was the mog immaculate, stylish, modern, and comfortable AirBnB experience I've ever had. The owner has spared no expense, from stainless steel alliances to remodeled bathrooms and showers, to new wood flooring. The temper-pedic bed was heavenly, and the furnishings were modern and comfortable. The attention to detail was unparalleled, from train maps and restaurant guides to Chicago artwork and plenty of cooking utensils and supplies, as well as beauty and hygiene products. I was beyond impressed with the level of care and consideration.   When I return to Chicago in the future, this will be my first choice. Always.",1.0
Chicago,We were In Chicago to see Hamilton and sightsee with our teenaged daughter. We loved this location and neighborhood. It felt safe and there were tons of nearby places to eat or get groceries. The condo itself was extremely clean and was well stocked with necessities. It was spacious and we never felt crowded. Rob was a great host and was very responsive to our questions. It was a plus to have  parking available as we never moved our car until we left Chicago. I would definitely rent from Rob again,1.0
Chicago,"Rob's place is incredibly stylish, supremely located, and overall provides a comfortable, beautiful perch from which to explore the city of Chicago.

Chicago,"This place is a fantastic stay!  Everything is wonderfully decorated, well thought-out, very clean, and it has an authenticity you can only find in a beautiful historic building.  The location is great as well. It’s a 13 minute drive to downtown Chicago, and 500 feet from the best breakfast place in town “Whisk”. You must go there!  Only thing missing in the Airbnb was coffee, so you may want to bring your own. But they have multiple ways to make it if you do.  Great stay, highly recommend this Airbnb!",1.0
Chicago,My wife and I came in to Chicago for our wedding anniversary and are so glad we chose to stay with Rob.  Probably the best Airbnb experience we’ve had.  He really thinks of everything and we can’t recommend staying here enough.,1.0

Chicago,"By far-this Rob's place is the most STUNNING home my husband and I stayed in. The décor is stylish, modern and pure class. The Holiday decorations made it festive and cozy. I really want those flocked trees!! LOL Absolutely gorgeous. The pictures of this listing does it NO JUSTICE!! Rob is a delight and one of thee most gracious hosts I have encountered. His level of hospitality is unparalleled and he gave us some great suggestions of local eateries in the area. His home is in great proximity to downtown and other neighborhoods. We truly could not be more pleased and dreaded leaving to return back to our home state. However, we will certainly be back and definitely in the process of making plans to book Rob's home again. You will not be disappointed!! Truly his home is a GEM!!!",1.0
Chicago,"The warmest home we've ever been in. Sparkling clean, modern and superb interior design, great location and a very lovely, warm host. Thank you, Rob and we promise to only stay at your place whenever we're in Chicago! An experience to remember!",1.0
Chicago,"This was the cleanest Airbnb we’ve ever stayed in. If you are picky with finding a clean place that actually FEELS clean, this home is for you. You can immediately tell that Rob takes pride in his apartment and everything is so well maintained and stylishly decorated. The bed was a welcomed place for rest after a long day, and we loved how firm the mattress was and how fluffy the pillows were—very comfortable.  The amenities were spot on, the coffeemaker, the gas stove, plenty of dishes and quality cookware to use for making a meal. Not mention, the exceptional decor of the entire apartment! The location was excellent and walkable to numerous local restaurants and bars (a few were literally steps from the apartment door). We loved being on the third floor and always felt super safe. There is some traffic noise that can be heard in the bedroom, but Rob provides earplugs for light sleepers. In truth, we actually enjoyed being lulled to sleep by the sounds of the city and it didn’t bother us at all. The convenience of the grocery store being a 5 minute walk away made buying some pantry and fridge essentials easy. The couch in the living room was super comfy and perfect for relaxing and watching the Thanksgiving Day parade and some Netflix Christmas movies. This was the perfect Airbnb and we were highly impressed (not always easy). 5 stars to Rob for such an amazingly clean, comfortable, stylish, and well thought out home away from home. We’ll be back soon!",1.0
Chicago,"This place is so much nicer in person! And wow the bed was so comfortable we ended up sleeping the first night we got there instead of going out because we got trapped in the bed lol. Communicating with Rob was very easy and his home was supplied with everything!! First aid kit, make up remover wipes you name it lol. The home is in a very quiet and safe neighborhood. Would definitely stay again, one of the nicest places I have ever stayed!",1.0
Chicago,"We had a short but wonderful stay at Rob's place for a weekend trip to Chicago. Communication and check-in were quick and easy, and it was a breeze to get there from the airport on the train and a bus.  The space was spotlessly clean and beautifully furnished, with thoughtful touches that made our stay really comfortable. The location is great too, with a grocery store nearby and lots of good food/drink options as well.  Our only regrets are that we didn't stay here longer to enjoy it more and that we had to catch a Sunday morning flight before we could peruse the beautiful store downstairs some more. We would definitely stay here again, and will happily recommend it to any family and friends who may be looking for a place to stay in Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"Rob’s apartment was exactly what we need for a wonderful stay in Chicago. It was styled beautifully and Rob provided everything we could possibly need- thought of everything!

Chicago,"This might be my favorite Airbnb stay to date. The apartment so stunning, clean, and comfortable and charming Ukrainian Village with so much to offer, we chose to make fewer trips into the heart of the city to spend more time enjoying and exploring the immediate surroundings both in and out of the apartment. Yoga, restaurants, shops, grocery...everything within walking distance and this little oasis to temporarily call home. Rob couldn’t have been a better host. Will be back for sure!",1.0
Chicago,Rob’s place was amazing. Right in the center of everything. The location was close to many restaurants and bars. It is also a short ride to surrounding neighborhoods and downtown. The place itself was amazing with all the amenities needed for a great stay. Rob was prompt in his communication and was right below if needed.

Chicago,"Location, atmosphere, beautiful decor, every thought to amenities (even a First Aid Kit!)... you simply can't go wrong with this great condo in Ukrainian Village.  It was a snowy weekend so we especially enjoyed the cabinet full of games!  We were visiting family in Streeterville and getting there was no problem at all.  Rob greeted us when I arrived, and check-out was very simple.  Also, my brother drove over from a neighboring city to meet me, so we appreciated the off-street parking for him and his daughter.  Stay with Rob!  You won't regret it.",1.0

Extremely clean. Special touches such as video games and snacks. Went above and beyond to provide a welcoming and safe environment. Room was stylized, modern. Plenty of amenities, even access to laundry. If we make our way back to town, we’ll stay here again. Thank you for making our first AirBNB memorable!",1.0
Chicago,"Great place to stay! Very clean and convenient to food and shops! Reminded me of being Ina little apartment. The shower was a bit small, so if you're a larger person it may be difficult to fit. But it was a very nice place and the host were quick to respond.",1.0

The decor is fantastic and we loved many of the little touches including the board games, tasteful art, game systems, and the water and drinks in the fridge were a welcome surprise after our evening arrival. Having central heat as well as a space heater in the unit helped make sure we stayed nice and toasty during our visit. We didn't take advantage of them, but the fact that a washer and dryer were available was a nice bonus.   We'll definitely look here first on our next trip to Chicago!",1.0

Chicago,"What a gem! Christopher’s place was exactly as described including a ton of extras. Christopher was quick to respond before and during my stay. He left a light on for me the night I arrived since I had a super late flight. He even checked in on me the next day to make sure I had everything I needed. The place was totally spotless. The bed was very comfy and there were tons of extra pillows. The kitchen was fully equipped and he even stocked it with several quick food items. These were much appreciated especially the first morning. The space felt so much more roomy than I was expecting. Ceilings are a bit lower being a garden unit but I had no problem at all with it. The water pressure in the shower was really great. Christopher made a really detailed welcome guide with lots of great info abt the neighborhood. The studio is only 3 short blocks away from a bus that takes you directly to the belmont el station (abt a 20-30 min ride). I felt very safe in the neighborhood (family vibe) even when coming in using transit late at night by myself. If you are wanting to do a lot of things in the Loop, transit took me 45-hour sometimes depending on the time of day. This was not a big deal for me bc I wanted a neighborhood experience vs more of a downtown touristy one, but it did take longer to get to and from. Lastly, Christopher was kind enough to  hold my luggage for me on my last day since I had a later flight. All in all, fantastic experience and I highly recommend this listing. Thank you so much, Christopher!",1.0
Chicago,Christopher’s place was was everything I could have hoped for. It was a nice cozy place where my girlfriend and I felt immediately at home.

Chicago,This is such a great place to stay! Awesome location between the airport and downtown. Uber’s were always there within 5 minutes and were reasonably priced for a ride to anywhere in the city.

Transportation was nearby and made our rides to the city very convinient, also we got to explore more of it by using transportation.

The water in the fridge was appreciated! We only stayed one night, but this place has everything you'd need for an extended stay. ",1.0
Chicago,Chris was an amazing host.  His place was very clean and better than we expected.  This was the wife’s first time visiting Chicago and she wasn’t disappointed as this place offers a lot of space for two guests.  Parking on the same street was hit and miss but that can be expected for a big city.  We took Lyft anytime we were visiting downtown Chicago.  It was nice to come and go as we pleased.  Chris responded very quickly to any messages that were sent.  I felt safe enough walking in the general neighborhood.  When we visit Chicago again this would definitely be the first choice.  Our first host cancelled which brought us to finding this gem.,1.0

Chicago,"Samantha & Jonathan's loft was exactly as pictured, and located in a convenient location. I loved the apartment - I would love to live here myself! The stairs to the loft was quite steep as others describe, and I left my suitcase downstairs and only went upstairs to sleep. The bed was very comfortable. My friend whom I stayed with wanted an easy access to the bathroom during night, so she decided to use the air mattress downstairs, which we found in the closet (we moved furnitures around to make space). The walk to the California CTA station was 15-20 min for me, but since it was quite a cold week, I often opted for Uber. As we had packed plans in downtown, we did not get to explore much of the neighborhood nor get to ask for neighborhood tips that Samantha was happy to share, but I'd love to come back to this loft and explore more!",1.0
Chicago,"The loft is located in a great quiet spot that is walking distance from great restaurants and bars. It was a ~15 minute walk from both the Logan Square and California blue line stops, and extremely close to tons and tons of good restaurants and bars (check out Lula, Giant, and Longman & Eagle). Samantha was a great host and the place was spotless when we arrived, with tea and some nice snacks sitting on the table. Checking in and out was as easy and quick as it gets, and we appreciated Samantha periodically messaging us to check on our experience. We would stay here again in a heartbeat. Our only warning is that all the stairs in the building are extremely steep and narrow. We didn't have any problems, but you should be careful. Overall a 5/5 experience.",1.0
Chicago,"The space is exactly as pictured.  Simple, basic, perfect for one or two people.  The bed in the loft was comfortable and the HDTV had plenty of premium channels.

Major bus line is 3 blocks away that will take you straight to the northside Fullerton train stops and the Blue Line station that goes to the loop is about 8 blocks away.  The host is easily reached and communication was great.  Thanks!",1.0

The apartment itself is really, really nice. Clean, spacious and an extremely comfy bed. I would highly recommend it to anybody!",1.0
Chicago,A very stylish flat with lots of complimentary toiletries and helpful guide books for the area. The flat isn’t in the city centre but taking an Uber carpool is a cheap and easy way of getting into the main part.,1.0
Chicago,This is a beautifully-designed loft apartment in an upmarket part of town.  It is sparkling clean and has some nice touches such as local coffee. Communication with Samantha was very smooth and she answered our questions quickly.  I would highly recommend staying here in Chicago.,1.0
Chicago,"Lovely apartment in a great area of the city.  Local amenities were perfect (I'd recommend Tony's for any grocery requirement and Wyler Road for a chilled drink and a bit to eat!) and not too far from the ""L"" to the Loop where it's a 20 min ride in.   Hosts were great and very responsive to any request and requirement we had and helped out as much as possible.  The stairs up to the mezzanine are definitely steep but we expected this from the description so not a problem at all and the apartment is carefully thought out to give maximum usability of the space.  Overall a fantastic expperience of this amazing city.",1.0
Chicago,"Place was amazing! My boyfriend and I absolutely loved our stay here in this loft. Area is very clean and very stylish. All of our questions were answered very fast and accurately. Everything was supplied for us, they even had Q-tips lol. ",1.0
Chicago,"We had an amazing stay at Samantha's place. It is located in a quiet neighborhood within 20min walking distance from the blue line. The apartment is spacious and has everything you need including cooking facilities, big comfortable bed, tv etc. We were a bit delayed and arrived late in the evening, but Samantha was extremely kind by helping us ordering pizza while we were absolutely wrecked from traveling. Furthermore, she always responded very quickly to questions from us. We ran in to her husband Jonathan a couple of times who was also super friendly and gave us a ton of advice on what to do in the city. Overall we had a great couple of days in Chicago and we definitely recommend this place! ",1.0
Chicago,"Samantha's place was perfect for our weekend getaway. Travel around the city was very convenient with transit and biking options very closeby. The space was extremely tidy and comfortable, and our hosts were very accommodating...thanks for a wonderful Chicago experience!",1.0
Chicago,"This apartment is great! The apartment itself is already beautiful and special with its high ceilings, and the location is also very nice. In walking distance from Logan square, with nice coffee bars, restaurants, shops and street art. But also in walking distance from public transport that takes you to downtown in just a few stops. We would definitely recommend this place for a great visit to this great city",1.0
Chicago,"Lovely loft studio, spotlessly clean and very well designed with everything we needed. Location is good with the metro about 15 mins walk away then 20 mins to downtown, and a Chicago bike scheme station 5mins away and an even quicker cycle to downtown. We also enjoyed the 606 trail, Chicago's answer to the Highline which is also close by.  So a great place and a great location.",1.0
Chicago,Beautiful apartment in quite neighborhood. The space is great it's location relative to public transit is awesome. Samantha was quick to respond to any questions. I will definitely be checking availability next time I'm back in Chicago.,1.0
Chicago,"We had a great stay at Logan Square. The appartment was spacious (more so than we expected) and very clean with thoughtful provisions provided.   Samantha and Jonathon provided us with a great list of nearby places do eat and drink (from fresh coffee to pizza) and were very helpful in communicating when we asked for help.   Logan Sqaure itself is a lovely leafy neighbourhood around half an hr from Downtown on the train. There's plenty of amenities a short walk from the appartment, as well as loads of great bars. A taxi into Downtown is quicker but more expensive.   The 'L' (elevated train) is a 15-20 min walk from the appt and then a further 15 min or so ride into downtown where there is plenty to do. A weekly ticket for the train is around $30 and gives you access to trains and buses. Very handy for getting around as the bus and L system is easy to use.  On a clear day, we would recommend hiring a bike and taking the Lake Shore route which runs alongside Lake Michigan. You get stunning views of the iconic skyscrapers from across the water.  Hancock Tower on a clear day is also a must see too, with great views for miles.  If the weather is cooler, then there are loads of great museums to visit. the History of Chicago by Lincoln Park is great. The Old Town is nearby for a drink afterwards too.  Definitely a great city to visit with lots to do, and a great appartment in a great neighbourhood. 10/10  Thanks",1.0
Chicago,"The apartment was lovely, clean, and the coffee/snacks were appreciated. The security within the apartment was great, and although the surrounding area was less confidence-inspiring, she had us send a photo of our car once we arrived, and the area had cameras, so it put me at ease. We were super close to both bus and train options that we utilized several times, and within walking distance of target for quick pick-ups. We enjoyed our stay!",1.0
Chicago,"Kay is the best superhost you will ever have!! She is great with communication and is very welcoming! Her apartment has a home-like feeling that will make your vacation even better. Cleanest place ever!! Absolutely spotless and smells amazing!!  If you are looking for suggestions of where to eat and shop, Kay will give you a list of her favorite places and provides a variety brochures, pamphlets, flyers, and food menu’s! I had mentioned my family was vegan and she gave me options of food choices around the area!  Great location!!! I highly recommend staying at Kay’s place if you are visiting Chicago!!",1.0
Chicago,"Kay’s place was very cute and clean!! She was super quick to respond to anything. The train is a quick walk from the apartment though I don’t think I would personally feel safe walking from the train tooo late at night as a young lady. Loved how she  had treats available like bananas, it’s, orange juice, coffee. It is very convenient for a quick trip to downtown Chicago!",1.0
Chicago,"Even though Kay's place was more on the south side of Chicago and I was going to the north side for a Cubs game, her place was great for a one-night stay with how reasonably priced it was right before Memorial Day weekend. I just got ubers to get to and from the game rather than public transit. Kay's place was very comfortable and she was a great host!",1.0
Chicago,"Kay’s place was amazing! Such thoughtful, kind touches, and Kay is super communicative. Seriously, this room was nicer and more well-equipped than some of the luxury hotel’s I’ve stayed at. 100% would stay here again!",1.0
Chicago,"From the extreme cleanliness of the apartment to the added extras everywhere you turn, this place was absolutely perfect! The host is respectful and generous with the most friendly senior kitty ever! Coming “home” to a snuggly feline in the living room was probably the best thing ever (I’m an extreme cat person). However, if you’re not into cats, no worries; the cat isn’t pushy and you could probably spend your entire trip ~not~ seeing him if that’s more your style. The off-street parking was clean and safe, something that can be hard to secure in Chicago. The apartment is located very close to both the train and the bus, making in-city traveling quite easy. I would highly recommend this AirBnB!",1.0
Chicago,It’s a wonderful and comfortable place to stay. Kay is really great at communicating with guests and is super nice and welcoming. The space is very clean and has a nice charm to it. We only stayed for one night but I definitely will keep this place in mind if I ever make it up to Chicago again.,1.0
Chicago,I extremely enjoyed my stay at Kay's place.  The location is perfect. My favorite part was having a Target with a Starbucks and market near by. This place is also closely located to a CTA and the freeway entrance if you have a car.  Kay provides many good ameneties and I was very happy for that. She is quickly responsive and super helpful. I'm glad I got to meet her. She is a sweet person.  It is 15 min away from the city.    Also if you have a rental/car there is parking near by!!!  Thanks Kay,1.0
Chicago,"Five stars isn’t enough! Kay made me feel very welcome and comfortable. I felt as if I was staying with family or an old friend, definitely not a stranger. She provided breakfast and coffee for me before I headed out and it definitely gave me a great start. I have a cat at my place, so their friendly lil guy made me feel even more at home. I would definitely recommend her to anyone else and will definitely stay with her again if the opportunity arises.",1.0
Chicago,"I was pleasantly surprised by how amazing the experience turned out to be at Kay's home. The entire house felt inviting and immediately puts you at ease. She puts the guest first and it shows in her thoughtful approach to outfitting the room. From soft bath towels and a loofah at your bedside, to the coffee and tea bar in the kitchen for hot drinks in the morning. She really wants you to feel like you are taken care of the moment you walk in the door. The location is convenient with good selection of restaurants in the area to choose from and downtown is a hop and a skip away for those who want to take in the sights. If it isn't obvious already,  I highly recommend staying with Kay during your trip to Chicago!",1.0
Chicago,"I stayed at Kay's place with two of my friends over St. Pat's weekend. The free parking was a huge blessing, and the apartment was very close to the CTA for local travel. The apartment itself was clean and well-kept. Kay was a wonderful host! From giving us travel recommendations to providing some St. Patrick's day accessories, she made our stay as enjoyable as possible. We also enjoyed helping ourselves to the coffee bar and playing with her adorable cat. All of our expectations for our stay were far exceeded and I would gladly stay here again.",1.0

Chicago,"A great experience. Had everything I needed within steps of walking into the house. Washing machine, bathroom with soap and shampoo, a lot of towels, my own fridge, snacks and water bottles. The cat was very friendly. Kay did a great job with her Airbnb!",1.0
Chicago,"Kay was a perfect host. She went out of her way to make sure I was comfortable and ensured I had everything I needed. Her place is so cute and even offers a breakfast bar with coffee, snacks and breakfast foods. She even left a loofa, towels and washcloths for me with chocolates. Also, there were loads of local brochures and magazines to browse. Her 16 year old cat Toby is such a love! He was super friendly and sweet. It was raining on the day I was going out to adventure in the city and I Kay was so cool about lending me her umbrella. She’s a kind soul and was so helpful with local tips for eats and getting around. Highly recommend staying at Kay’s!",1.0
Chicago,"Kay provided a great Airbnb! She was prompt in her responses and provided a few extra touches that made our stay very welcoming (water bottles in the room's mini-fridge, clear and prompt communication, breakfast items (although we skipped out on those), well-labeled instructions outside the door on how to get in as well as within the house to make things very clear, etc.)",1.0
Chicago,"Best Airbnb I've stayed in! Clean, safe, great communication, fantastic amenities, nice and modern/cozy/stylish vibe, easy check in and out, great location: basically this Airbnb had it all and then some! Kay was also super nice and accommodating. I would definitely stay here again and recommend to others!",1.0
Chicago,"Kay's place was perfect for me- free parking in a lot, close to the metro, and south (the direction I was coming from).  Kay is friendly, and her place is clean.  I'll definitely see if Kay's place is available the next time I  visit Chicago!",1.0
Chicago,Kay is an Amazing host with an air bnb that makes you feel at home! The entire house is sparkling clean and full of creative and cute decor. This room is spacious and fully furnished with all the amenities you may need. The check-in/out is simple with thorough instructions. The el (CTA train) is a short 5min walk in a safe neighborhood. This is the second time I’ve stayed here and both times there were other guests yet it was very quiet and comfortable stay and rest. Respect this space as it truly is a gem!,1.0
Chicago,Great stay. Kay’s place was in a great location close to downtown and public transportation. The room and bathroom were very clean and had nice touches. Didn’t meet Kay until the last night (my schedule) but she was very nice and personable. If definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone!! Thank you Kay,1.0
Chicago,"This place is really conveniently located on the orange line train, will take you  straight t midway and downtown. Toby the grandpa cat is awesome. He likes to be pet and hangout with you. The coffee bar and snacks are great too.",1.0
Chicago,"Kay's place was really awesome in a good neighborhood, easily accessible from public transport. Very highly recommended, especially for budget travelers like myself.   The apartment and room were cozy and I felt like being at home during my stay, with access to kitchen and living room area. The cat is super friendly too!   Kay as a person was a nice host. She even gave me some medicine upon request, as I was catching some cold from the weather in Chicago.   If I ever come back to Chicago I have a reliable place to stay :)",1.0
Chicago,"Kay is an absolute pro of a host.  She communicated check-in instructions very clearly and regularly  touched-base to make sure I had everything I needed during my stay.  Her place is ideally situated a mere 5 minute walk from an L train station (which is a fantastic way to get around Chicago as I discovered).  Very comfortable, clean, and safe place to spend your nights when visiting Chicago-- can't recommend enough.",1.0
Chicago,"The misfortune of staying at Kay's is that one will quickly realize that not every host will be like her! :-/ I was able to take the train (as she pre-stay suggested) directly out of midway and walk about 2 blocks & if cleanliness is next to godliness, then trust Kay has you covered. And to be completely honest, Kay extended herself to me in an act that goes way beyond the scope of AirBnb. I was comfortable, I felt safe, the room was very dedicated. Being that she was my 1st AirBnb experience,  I really feel like I lucked up. Omg, and her snack bar (fresh yummies), were too delish! :-* #BookHer",1.0
Chicago,"Kay is a fantastic host and I can not recommend her enough. When we contacted her for anything we needed, the response was lightning-fast! She was courteous and made her home warm and inviting for her guests. She really took a burden off our shoulders while planning a last-minute trip to Chicago. If you’re looking for a great experience for a really reasonable price, definitely book with Kay!",1.0
Chicago,"If I could give 6 stars I would. Kay's place was immaculate, cute, comfortable, easy to access — everything you could ask for in an Airbnb. Kay herself is an excellent and hospitable host, helping us out with umbrellas, breakfast, sunscreen, loofas — all the little things that shows she truly cares about making her guests' experience as amazing as possible. She is a gracious and generous person and I would 100% stay at her property again. ",1.0
Chicago,"If you don't like stairs or cats, that is the only reason not to stay here. Location is good, ample parking & light outdoors- ammenities are top & Kay is an awesome host with a BIG heart for her aging cat- that alone should make her 1st choice for any cat lover.",1.0
Chicago,Kay's place was absolutely amazing. She was a perfect host and made my vacation feel so comfortable. I was traveling alone and one late night she even messaged me to make sure I was ok. I think that was such an amazing gesture. The room and apartment was exactly as described and so comfortable. ,1.0

Chicago,"If you want to have a a good time in Chicago, don't stay at Danielle's place..... If you want to have A FABULOUS TIME IN CHICAGO, STAY HERE! I cannot rave about this place enough. So cozy. So well equipped with everything you could ever need. Danielle has a very charming place with thoughtful touches all around.  Heated floors, a fireplace, fully stocked kitchen and bathroom. We felt right at home. My colleagues and I kept looking around saying, ""I love this place. I don't want to leave"". On more than one night, we decided to stay in (rather than go out) just so we could enjoy the fire, movie, selection, and some homemade pasta! I will definiltey be recommending this to anyone and everyone who plans to visit Chicago. BONUS: Just down the street from the best diner/vegan food in the world.",1.0

Chicago,"Danielle’s space was perfect for our trip to Chicago. There were four of us, so we did two in each bed — totally comfortable. As it was February in Chicago, we loved the fireplace to keep the space nice and warm. The flat was very clean, and stocked with towels and products for the shower. Danielle gave us a mega list of recommendations ahead of time, which was super helpful and full of cool restaurants and bars. The apartment is in Logan Square, and while we spent a good deal of time there and in places like Wicker Park, the freezing weather had us in lots of Uber’s downtown as well — just something to keep in mind. Though, it’s also off a subway line. Overall, no complaints, and Danielle’s communication was amazing. Would definitely recommend.",1.0
Chicago,I love love love Danielle's place.  It's extremely charming and well decorated. You can definitely tell she put a lot of effort into all the details of the apartment. It was perfect for a winter visit to Chicago with the amazing fireplace and heated floors. The walkways and stairs were kept clear of snow and salted. We even heard a snow blower once or twice ;).

I would highly recommend staying here and will likely book it again.,1.0

Chicago,"Danielle's place is very roomy, clean, and comfortable to stay in.  Everything you need is in her place even a washing machine and dryer.

HIGHLY recommend. Cheers! ",1.0
Chicago,"If you was to stay in an eclectic hipster neighborhood with a mix of old charm and graffiti art, then this place is perfect.  The home is adorable, with vintage industrial flare that lets you submerge yourself into the Chicago culture.

This was a great way to experience Chicago.  ",1.0

There are good restaurants within an easy walk, and tons of stuff within a 10 minute drive.  The L train was very quick to get to and the walk felt totally safe. The apartment is not very close to all the tourist attractions, but the train ride was pretty quick and we really enjoyed being in a neighborhood where people actually live.  We would definitely stay here again!",1.0

Chicago,"I stayed here with some friends for the gay pride parade and festivities( amazing experience).The place was so adorable and comfy and clean and overall just a great place to stay. it’s far enough out of the city to where it’s quiet but close enough to where it is fairly easy to get to everything. We found parking by the place and using lyft to get around created the best situation for us! Host was very kind, quick to respond, and very helpful in general. 10/10 would recommend to anyone looking to stay in the Chicago area.",1.0
Chicago,The home and neighborhood are both amazing! Very trendy with lots of great places to eat and drink — staying here really made you feel like a local.

We’d definitely stay again!",1.0

Chicago,Danielle's place is great! It's conveniently located near Chicago's most hip neighborhood Logan Square with a ton of nice bars and restaurants.

Chicago,"I’ve stayed at several Airbnb spots throughout Chicago over the past year for work travel, and this was easily one of the best. The space is incredibly charming with very thoughtful touches, it’s minutes from the Blue line, and in one of the best neighborhoods in the city for great food.  If you want explore the Logan Square neighborhood or just want a nice place with easy access to downtown, I’d definitely recommend staying here.",1.0
Chicago,"This has got to be in the top two best airbnb experiences I've had. Danielle's place is so cozy and looks amazing. We ended up spending a lazy Sunday lounging inside by the fireplace and watching dumb movies - an ideal way to spend a day after heavy touristing Friday and Saturday. She was incredibly accommodating throughout our stay with complications our party had with check in and check out. The surrounding area had an incredible pizza place, a bar where we got boozy ice cream floats, some breweries, and way more that we didn't have time to discover because we didn't want to leave the fire. Will 100% look to stay here again in the future!",1.0
Chicago,Excellent accommodation in quiet location (with easy access to the city centre). Very well presented apartment - the host has clearly gone to a lot of effort with the stylish detail. The underfloor heating is amazing and plenty of throws for the evening - flawless.,1.0

Everything we needed was there, dish washer, washing machine with dryer, fast internet, nice big screen TV. I especially enjoyed all the books in the apartment!  Checking in was effortless with good instructions. Location is good, easy access from the airport and to the city with the CTA blue line. Logan Square neighborhood, while still a bit rough around the edges, is very interesting. Lots of good eateries, galleries and shops. You have to check out Lula Cafe.",1.0
Chicago,"Stayed a wintery week in Danielle's cozy space. The apartment was exactly as published and proved to be a nice base for exploring Chicago. The train was an easy walk and Logan Square is a cool and friendly neighborhood. From day one, Danielle proved to be a good communicator and a welcoming host. I would definitely consider staying with her again.",1.0
Chicago,"This was my second stay at Ellie’s place, and I maintain that it’s one of the best Airbnbs ever! So quiet, clean, stylish, and comfortable. The tub is awesome and the coffee’s great, what more could I ask for?",1.0
Chicago,"Place was great! Clean, cozy, great location. Check in & out went seamlessly. LOVED the bathtub and shower. I would definitely recommend. The TV package was a surprising plus.. not usually one to hang out too much at a bnb- but after a day of drinking at Wrigley we were feeling a little rough-  it was so nice to just chill out the next day watching movies and ordering food! Loved it!",1.0
Chicago,"As a single traveler the studio set up was perfect for me. The location was great, since I had just been staying downtown at a conference prior to my stay it was nice to get out a bit and see some other neighborhoods. I could easily walk to the 606 Trail - which I really enjoyed - and N Milwaukee Ave for some fun shopping. I appreciated the guide they had in the studio with local recommendations listed, I got take-out from the Indian place down the street and it was delicious. Very comfortable bed!",1.0

Chicago,"I absolutely loved this place! I already told my sister that when we get the chance to go to Chicago together we will absolutely have to stay there. It was the perfect size and had everything I needed. The style of the whole place was gorgeous. I can tell a lot of thought went into creating this space. The shower and bathtub were amazing, and it was very helpful that there was a hair dryer, shampoo/conditioner, body wash, etc. When I do get the chance to travel to Chicago again I hope this is available. I can’t say enough about how much I loved this place!",1.0
Chicago,"From the incredibly easy check in and location, to the thoughtful touches that made us feel at home, to the impeccably curated style, we absolutely loved stayed here. It will be our go to any time we are back in Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"What can I say except that Elinor’s place was great! The little touches, such as welcome beers, pour over coffee, books on Chicago, and available toilet trees (we flew in and only had carry-one) were perfect. We only used the room for sleeping since we spent most of our day and night exploring the city! The weather is Chicago sure is unpredictable and crazy, so make sure you have a jacket or umbrella on stand by! Haha Thank you again for allowing us to stay in your lovely place!",1.0

Chicago,"OMG this place is so fantastic. It's PERFECT. I'm going to stay here again for sure! Great location, excellent host, so stylish and cool. The place also comes with an amazing little booklet to tell you how to use the WiFi and coffeemaker, and how to get around.",1.0
Chicago,"If I had more a sense of self-interest, I would write the  worst review ever so that this amazing space is always available for me when I'm in Chicago. First: it is it's own little building in the city. Wow! It's designed so beautifully, I took tons of photos to inspire my guest house back in CT. Elinor was responsive, accommodating, and super nice. I'm spreading the word to all of my friends who are jazzed staying there. The location is 10-12 minutes from downtown... well worth it for these gorgeous accommodations. BTW: the photos don't really capture the details and inviting sweetness of the place. I'll see you again, Elinor!",1.0
Chicago,"Ellie and Devin's space is charming! It's a well-designed, well-maintained large studio with incredibly thoughtful touches: books about the history of Chicago, more books from Chicago based writers and poets, games, postcards, and even stamps. I was a little nervous the first night with the studio being so close to the street, but I slept like a dream – the bed is comfortable and the studio is airy and bright. The place is exactly as pictured, even better. Ellie and Devin were very responsive and helpful. I would definitely come back and highly recommend staying here.",1.0

Chicago,"I can’t say it enough- this is THE best Airbnb I’ve ever stayed at and is so cozy! It’s worth every penny! I came to take my boards and it was just perfect for the stay. It’s so stylish, quaint, adorable neighborhood, and the little touches are unlimited! There was wine and beer stocked in the fridge, a cute pour over coffee pot and trader joe beans with a grinder! Basically I’m sad I can’t just move and stay in forever. People always say, “oh I’ll be back” but this is serious, I can’t wait to book again! I have best friends who live in the city and I’d still pay to stay in this awesome space! Airbnb MVP! Don’t hesitate! Book it now!",1.0

Chicago,"Great place! Great host! We actually had major delays on our flight out of Chicago and she offered for us to stay another night. We felt loved and cared for. If you want a spot not in the downtown hustle but still in the city enough to Uber for good rates, look no further. Quiet neighborhood. Pictures described the space very accurately. It was the perfect space for a quick getaway to Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"Amazing and beautiful first airbnb experience. The place was decorated very modern and was clean. Both the walk in shower and claw-foot tub were great and the water got very hot. The bed was super comfy! There were plenty of towels, extra sheets, and blankets to use as well. There were also nice personal touches such as food recommendations and stocked beverages in the fridge (water filter, coffee, and some wine). Me and my boyfriend had an amazing time.",1.0
Chicago,"Wonderful place to stay while visiting the windy city of Chicago! Not far from great restaurant, bars, shopping and downtown. The coach house is decorated to perfection in mid-century modern decor and very clean. My husband and I used Uber all weekend and waiting no longer than 2 min. for a pickup at the house.  Highly recommend a stay at this location.",1.0
Chicago,"Great place to stay in Chicago. The space is very functionable and artsy, open and airy- we loved it. Comfy bed, all amenities you would want and then far more are provided. There are even beautiful post cards for you to write home with! Highly recommend it!",1.0
Chicago,Ellie’s place is exactly what you see in the all - no false advertising. It’s very light and open and she maximizes the space greatly. She’s very easy to communicate with. The Damen & Western L stations are close enough walk which we utilized a lot. Would definitely stay here again!,1.0
Chicago,"Gorgeous! I loved staying here. It was in a cool neighborhood and the studio was clean, styled well, and the bathroom was top notch. I want to stay here every time I come back to Chicago. They also have postcards and stamps for your use. Sweet little detail. Thanks so much!",1.0

Chicago,"This is a gem of a space that is a close walk to some great cafes, shopping, and night life. As someone who travels a fair amount, I would say this was one of my favorite stays at an AirBNB. The space itself is very thoughtfully curated. ",1.0
Chicago,"There is a reason so many reviews start with how stylish the place is. That reason is because it is stunning and just as advertised! The level of detail and thought put in to the design is unbelievable.   Location is great, quick walk to the blue line. Check in/out is super easy, and the studio manual made our interactions minimal.   Great place to stay, will absolutely repeat.   Thanks again!",1.0
Chicago,"This place was great. It's worth the price just to swim around in that huge bathtub. Ellie was a great host, and the apartment had everything you could need for a great time in Chicago. I found most places I needed to go (food, cute shops, metro) to be about a ~10 min walk away, which I don't mind because I love to walk, but if you don't consider getting a car. It was really easy to get to downtown using the train. I have no complaints, this was an awesome  place!",1.0
Chicago,"This is such a cute, clean and comfortable space! I could stay here for weeks! Nice little neighborhood. Had initially worried about noise at night, but it did quiet down for a restful evening.  The fresh ground coffee, sodas, beer help to make it comfortable. Nice distance from downtown. Safe to run in the mornings with a park nearby. Love this place!",1.0
Chicago,"Ellie’s studio is absolutely stunning! She goes above & beyond for her guest! There are loads of local nicknacks laying around the studio to indulge into. She has her cabinets stocked with things one might need (ibuprofen, cotton swabs, razors, etc). The neighbor hood is very nice. There are not many of taxi’s in the area, so if you don’t drive one might want to download uber. Definitely worth the stay! Would definitely come back!",1.0
Chicago,"Fantastic stay! The studio was as pristine as pictured. You felt more like you were staying in a hotel than someone's home. Great amenities like shampoo, soft towels and even yoga mats! Would highly recommend,",1.0
Chicago,"Elinor's studio was a magical place, and I could tell as I soon as I stepped up to the door, because care was taken in styling the exterior with little faerie lights that sparkled. I hate to say this, but I can be a bit of snob when it comes aesthetic and decor. I have not one complaint about this studio. I was absolutely blown away. The incredible level of detail and design, even down to the studio's handbook was meticulous and thought out.  What's even more wonderful is the central location to all the haunts in the Bucktown/Wicker Park area. I drove and literally everywhere I went was less than a 10 minutes away. I can't imagine that taking public transportation would take any longer. If you do drive, Elinor provides a parking permit, which gives you the freedom to park anywhere in the vivinity without the fear of getting a ticket.  By far Elinor's place is one of the best spots I've stayed in for Air BnB. If you're looking for something magical and romantic (oh, I forgot to mention there's wonderfully restored claw-foot Victorian bath tub) look no further.",1.0
Chicago,Stayed here while visiting Chicago. The apartment was really clean and cozy and located in a really good location for our trip. We were able to park right out front for our stay and walk everywhere. If you're looking to spend time in the Ukrainian Village i would recommend staying here. Close to the train if ya want to travel other places too.,1.0
Chicago,"The initial observation of the space was of course a stylish space for a reasonable price.  Seeing the space in person is such an enjoyable experience - especially when noticing all the fine details not revealed in the online pics.  It is in those details that raises the level of impression and sets it apart from other spaces.    Elinor and I had minimal contact, but that was because instructions were clear on the check-in and check-out procedures, where to park, and even how to make the coffee - which we were thoroughly confused at first.    I enjoy exploring different places to stay when visiting areas, but I would consider staying here again on my next trip to Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"I enjoyed my stay at Elinor's studio apartment in Wicker Park.  The location was pefect for me.  The studio was quite stylish and had many personal touches, including a studio manual which I found quite helpful and fun.  I really appreciated the 2 bottles of wine and the beer selection in the fridge.  The kitchen was minimal but that was fine with me because I planned to enjoy Chicago's dining scene.  The bed was  very confortable, which was a definite plus.  The heater was somewhat louder than I was expecting, but that is the only concern I had.  I would definitely stay here again.",1.0
Chicago,"This is a great spot. Located near hip Wicker Park and related. Quiet, good access to Metro and very pleasant spot to hang out and do some work too. Hostess was very helpful on restaurants etc . This is a top BnB!!!",1.0
Chicago,"The space is exactly as described. Gorgeous. The bathroom is stylish, clean, and the shower is great. Would love to have a space like that in my own home tbh. They have cute touches throughout the studio, including Where Chefs Eat (I have that at home too!) and Studs Terkel's ""Working"" in the bathroom. The bed was really comfortable and once we figured out how to configure the NEST properly for our purposes, the temperature control was on point. One minor note is that both heat and cool air come out predominantly at the head of the bed, and it could be bothersome to people who are sensitive to dry air. My wife had to turn to the foot of the bed one night because she's super sensitive, but it didn't bother me much. The location was good for me because I don't need to be right downtown and don't mind taking a Lyft everywhere, plus I like to be in ""real"" neighborhoods. Puerto Rican restaurants abound as well as cool street art, if you care to venture around. It's about a twenty minute drive to many downtown area attractions. The hosts were very accommodating to my needs, as I had to cancel one day due to a family emergency. They were very easy to work with throughout. Will definitely look to return here my next stay in Chicago",1.0
Chicago,Elinor's place is close to perfect. Every corner of the space is thoughtfully detailed and styled. It's located very centrally to Logan Square and the Bucktown/Wicker Park area and I enjoyed walking the neighborhood in my downtime. Her communication was clear and extremely quick and I truly cannot say enough about how pleasant my stay was. Highly recommended.,1.0
Chicago,"Before I arrived, I loved the photos and thought the place would be perfect for my stay over New Year's. Walking in, it was somehow even better. From the furniture to the lighting to the tableware, everything in the space is very intentionally curated. I have a feeling the owners are designers; the whole place has a great aesthetic while still being comfortable. One of my favorite places I've stayed so far",1.0
Chicago,"We had a great stay at this charming, stylish studio. Clean digs and thoughtful touches like coffee, beer, and wine were lovely. Location was perfect for getting around town by foot or Lyft, yet the street itself was quiet and residential. Great host communication and simple check in and check out. Would stay again in a heartbeat!",1.0
Chicago,"I love this spot . The layout, decor and vibe are definitely hip. Everything is so easy + the communication with Elinor is on point. The amenities are great .

Chicago,"Beautiful decor with so much space! Instructions for checkin were easy to follow. The coffee and extras were great!  Very comfortable bed! The apartment has an urban ambiance. Jeremy provided parking passes and we were able to find parking a block away. Communication was excellent. Jeremy answered any questions I had almost immediately. Neighborhood had a safe feel. We walked to local restaurants close by. One unfortunate thing, which was no fault of our host- when we went to leave, we discoveredthat our catalytic converter was stolen off of our car. I had driven our older SUV since I knew it would be parked for several days. Turns out, these are easiervehicles to get under and cut. I would not hesitate to stay here again.",1.0
Chicago,"This Airbnb is the best! Location and space are the key highlights! Jeremy has great design taste! Close to the train and many restaurants. We would definitely stay here again! If you’re visiting, try the rolled ice cream across the street! We had it twice!",1.0
Chicago,"The apartment was absolutely fantastic and everything was as good as advertised. The entire unit was much more spacious than it appeared in the photos which was a welcomed surprise as I have stayed in several Airbnb's that were smaller than photographed.   You could not ask for a better location, one block from the blue line which made traveling to/from O'Hare and into downtown a breeze. You're also within walking distance to countless top notch restaurants and shops.  Jeremy was a very responsive and accommodating host and he really made us feel taken care of when we had some flight plan changes. I would recommend this apartment to anyone wanting to visit Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"There is much to like about this apartment.  It's spacious, has full amenities, plenty of character, parking is included, and the place is clean.  Wicker Park is growing, has a unique vibe, feels safe, and offers options within walking distance for groceries.  The area also has many choices for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and drinks.  We chose to use the kitchen for breakfast, and the waffle maker was a great perk.  A critical factor in comfort, rest and relaxation is the bed.  While clean, we found the mattress to be uncomfortable.  It currently presents itself as firm and lumpy with indentations and sag from years of use.  Upgrading this one very important item would make this location, apartment, and experience worth renting again.  We enjoyed our stay overall and will keep this as an option in the future.",1.0
Chicago,"Came to Chicago for my cousin's birthday party. It was in my old neighborhood, so I felt very much at home. The place was spacious and exactly how it was described! I briefly meet Jeremy when I arrived, he was extremely nice. Would love to come back here when I visit Chicago again.",1.0
Chicago,"I loved this loft and everything about it.  The location was great - 1.5 blocks from the CTA - we were able to explore the entire city using public transportation.  Check in and check out were a breeze.  Jeremy was kind and offered great suggestions when we met briefly during the stay.  The apartment was spotlessly clean, comfortable, quiet and well appointed.  This was my first visit to Chicago and I would gladly stay here on my next trip.",1.0
Chicago,"We loved this place. It's spacious and very convenient. If you have small children, you may want to know that there is a firehouse nearby, but it did not bother us, we expected city noises. There's a Metro station barely a block away. It's great to have a washer and dryer right in the apartment since we tend to pack very lightly. We greatly appreciated the neighborhood parking stickers Jeremey provided and we easily found parking about 1 block away on a safe, residential street. We'll stay here again next time we're in town.",1.0
Chicago,"This is a large, 1 bedroom apartment within 2 blocks of the blue line. Very convenient! There’s a well equipped full kitchen with a small grocery across the street. Of course there a numerous great restaurants in the area so there’s no need to cook. The apartment was very comfortable and clean. We had plenty of pillows, blankets, towels etc. which was much appreciated.",1.0
Chicago,"This was my very first AirBnB and if all of them are like this one, I'll never stay in a hotel again. Jeremey's communication was excellent from start to finish and his home is so beautiful and immaculate. It is easy to find and right off the blue line. The home had EVERYTHING I needed and then some. He even left me 2 day parking passes for the area which made people coming by easy to park nearby. It is in a very cool neighborhood and as a single woman staying in an area I've never been, I felt very safe. When I visit again, I would definitely stay there again.",1.0
Chicago,Jeremey is a wonderful host and his place is extremely nice. He is quick to respond with any questions and is willing to give recommendations around the city. The place was clean and decorated with care. It has everything you would need during your stay.,1.0
Chicago,"Jeremy's apartment is exactly as advertised - stylish, large, comfortable and spotlessly clean in a very safe, hip neighborhood.  The kitchen has all you would need to fix your own meals.  We, however, opted to take advantage of the multitude of excellent bars, coffee shops and restaurants within very easy walking distance on Division Street and North Milwaukee Avenue (for lovers of high quality Nepalese / Indian food we recommend Cumin on North Milwaukee). Communication with Jeremy was very easy.  If and when we return to this part of Chicago Wicker we would, without hesitation choose to stay in Jeremy's place.",1.0
Chicago,"We were very pleased with the apartment. With an updated modern kitchen and bathroom we had everything we needed to be comfortable. Jeremy was a great host, communicated all details we needed when needed.",1.0
Chicago,Jeremy's place was fantastic! It is really big. Was great to unpack and have space and feel at home. Really close to the blue line. Easy to get anywhere. Felt safe in the neighborhood. Fire station next door but never bothered us or woke us up. Would definitely stay again!,1.0
Chicago,Our stay was great! Jeremey was very responsive when we asked him about accommodating our two dogs during the stay. There was even a small crate provided that we ended up using for the smaller pup. Everything was just as described and the apartment is close to many great restaurants and shops. We'd stay again! :),1.0
Chicago,"Jeremey's place is fantastic -- it's bigger than we were expecting and has a really nice overall feel to it.  It's nicely decorated and has all the amenities you would need.  Jeremey was very quick to respond to messages and helped out if anything at all was needed.  Check-in was simple and the building felt secure.  It's just a couple minutes' walk to the blue line, which brings you right into downtown in about 10 minutes.  Also close to some cool spots on N Milwaukee, like Oiistar, the amazing ramen place.  Super nice experience and we'd definitely stay with Jeremey again!",1.0
Chicago,"This was perfect for our needs.  Everything was as advertised.  It's a beautiful space and the location is great.  (Ashland itself is not too appealing but you're a one-minute walk from blue line, can stroll west on Division or walk up Milwaukee Ave to Bucktown.).  Self-checkin was super easy and we had everything we needed.",1.0
Chicago,"Jeremy was very responsive, answering all questions quickly and thoroughly.  His place was nice and very clean.  My parents stayed at the Air BnB to visit me and were quite pleased.  Being that I own and live in downtown Chicago, I can say that this location fantastic and the price to be a great value.",1.0
Chicago,This place is one of the nicest accommodations I have ever stayed at. Yes the price is expensive compared to a hotel but if you want a solid night's sleep and little slice of home be sure to check out Jeremy's place!,1.0
Chicago,Wonderful place.  We really enjoyed ourselves and relaxed at Jeremey's loft.  Very clean.  We enjoyed being able to watch people on the streets from the loft.  Love the mixture of cultures which we don't get much of back home.  Location was great.  Very quick walk to get to Wicker Park and many great local restaurants as well.  Felt very safe in the neighborhood and at Jeremey's place.  Super nice people.  Jeremey is fantastic at returning messages.  Always a quick reply and we had no problems at all that couldn't be fixed quickly.  Highly recommend Jeremey's loft!,1.0
Chicago,"Jeremey's apartment far exceeded our expectations.  The pictures don't do justice to how beautiful, stylish and very spacious this place is, not to mention comfortable and clean.  Everything was simply perfect.  Every possible amenity to make you feel right at home--we wanted for nothing.  Comfortable bed and couches, beautiful, roomy bathroom with large shower and plenty of hot water, fully stocked kitchen, excellent wi-fi and incredibly easy check-in process. We loved the location, merely 2 short blocks (roughly 3 min) walk to the Blue line on the L/ subway.  So easy to get to the main attractions downtown, but also in a great spot to explore the Wicker Park/ West Town neighborhoods and all the great restaurants and shops.  An excellent Airbnb experience--Thank you, Jeremey!!",1.0
Chicago,We found it exactly as advertised—perhaps even better. Super accommodations in a great location. Jeremey was very accessible and promptly responded to our requests and questions. We look forward to staying there again on our next trip to Chicago.,1.0
Chicago,We LOVED the location. The area seemed very safe and was central to the blue line and a Divvy bike station. (Tip: take the blue line to and from O’hare to save a lot of money on transportation) The apartment was very roomy and we enjoyed having access to a kitchen. Something to note is the TV does not have cable or “smart” access. We ended up buying a firestick so we had something to watch while winding down at the end of our days. Jeremy was quick to respond any time we had questions or needed anything! Thank you for a great stay!,1.0
Chicago,"Better than it looked online, a beautiful space with everything needed and then some. Great location, close to public transportation and wonderful local spots. Jeremy was attentive and helpful with all of my queries. Would stay here whenever I’m in Chicago. Can’t recom enough!",1.0
Chicago,"This is a beautiful unit in a great neighborhood in Chicago.  Jeremy was a great host and was easy to communicate with.  Check-in and check-out were a breeze and the apartment was spotless.  It's on a busy street but there was very little noise.  The blue line is a block away as are Target, CVS and a bunch of great coffee shops and places to eat.  Also super easy to pick up a cab or an Uber/Lyft.  Would recommend this place without hesitation!",1.0
Chicago,Communication was fast and easy and Jeremey was available every step of the way.    Apartment was better than I expected.  Great location and very close to the Blue Line which can get you just about anywhere.     Would absolutely recommend and would stay here again in the future.   ,1.0
Chicago,"This is a spacious apartment and very nicely furnished. The location is just a few minutes walk from the blue line with quick transportation direct to the heart of downtown. Check-in was easy and the host provided a sheet with lots of helpful suggestions for local eating places, of which there are many.  Staying at Jeremey's place for 4 nights provided a very comfortable place to stay for our tired bodies after spending our days exploring Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,Jeremey’s place is very spacious and clean.  It has everything you need for a short or long term stay.  Jeremey is very nice and answers any question very promptly.  The location is also very convenient for travel on public transport.  Highly recommended!,1.0
Chicago,"Couldn't have asked for a better place. It was super easy to get to and from both town and O'Hare, with a Blue Line stop only one block away. It was beautiful and cheerful as well. Loved the full kitchen and nice extra-large tub. Jeremey was a lovely host. I wish we could have stayed even longer!",1.0
Chicago,"Great location with convenient transportation. The neighborhood has a cool vibe. As a vinyl record collector, I was excited about being across the street from Dusty Groove and close to Reckless Records. Great overall experience.",1.0
Chicago,"My wife and I spent 2 nights at Jeremey's place. While pictures can often be deceiving, we were pleasantly surprised at how large and open the apartment was in person. It was perfect. Jeremey was traveling in Spain at the time, but he was quick to respond to questions we had the day of and during the trip about things such as checking in and adjusting the nest thermostat. We'd happily stay there again.",1.0
Chicago,Great space in a convenient location—a vibrant neighborhood and just a block from blue line. The apartment has a good vibe and personality and is very clean. Jeremy was attentive and responsive. I’ll go back.,1.0
Chicago,"Jeremey's apartment is really great. It's large and bright in all the right places (and quieter and darker in the bedroom, which is lovely for sleeping), stylishly decorated (without being overdone--the decor fits the urban space perfectly), has a fantastic shower, everything you need for a comfortable stay and is in one of my favorite Chicago neighborhoods, with a bajiggety restaurants, bars, shops, etc. The provided parking passes are super helpful, especially for weekend stays, because parking in this part of the city is no joke (in fact, if you can manage without a car, do, because you won't need it once you're here--everything is walkable, lyft/uber is plentiful and the El train is literally right there.)  If mobility is an issue for you, you should know that you have to walk up a flight of steep, narrow stairs to get to the apartment. Also, it's really in the real city, and real cities generally aren't that quiet, so if you're a super sensitive sleeper who needs deep, dark silence, you'll maybe want to bring ear plugs and/or a sleep mask.   But otherwise, I completely recommend this place. Jeremey is a kind, helpful and responsive host, the apartment is so lovely, and it's a really great value for Chicago, too.",1.0
Chicago,"We enjoyed our stay at Jeremy’s place. It's conveniently located, about 15 minutes to the loop and 20 minutes to Midway airport. Although we got around with Uber, the blue line is just minutes across the street. The apartment is super clean and lovely decorated. Jeremy is very thoughtful with the travel guide and tips. It was great to meet a Cal alumni at Chicago. =) I would recommend this listing to everyone.",1.0
Chicago,"This home was great. Jeremey provided easy check in details and instructions. The location was great because I was close to everything downtown and many shops and stores. I recommend this home and would certainly stay here again. Thanks again, Jeremey!",1.0
Chicago,"Jeremy was easily accessible for any questions via text and he even checked in the second day to make sure everything was okay. The apartment spacious, comfortable and centrally located. Just a few steps to the blue line CTA train, restaurants and shops. The neighborhood is busy so the provided parking permits were a huge plus.",1.0
Chicago,"This space is amazing. Plenty of room, furnishings are great, kitchen has everything you could need, and the shower was perfect after a long day of exploring Chicago in the cold. Jeremey was prompt with responses and great about giving me tips on places to check out. Literally just a few steps away from the Blue Line which made getting around the city super easy. I will definitely be looking to get this place again next time I am in Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"Great place! We stayed there with our 18month during our summer holiday trip, all three of us loved Jeremey’s place. Bigger than expected. Jeremey was very supportive and fast with all kind of questions. We can highly recommend this place, also when you are traveling with small children.",1.0
Chicago,"What a great stay in Chicago!!! Jeremey‘s loft is perfectly situated in one of our favourite areas within Chicago. There are so many things to explore in walking distance: restaurants, shopping, parks, and the great 606 trail. The train („L“, blue line) - which is more or less directly in front of the apartment - connects you directly with downtown as well as with the airport. The apartment is so cool, we would love to live there! Despite the busy street in front of the house the apartments inside is so quiet and we slept like babies. Jeremey is a fantastic host and helped us a lot to find our ways, gave us great recommendations and answered immediately whenever we wrote a message. We will definitely come again!!!",1.0
Chicago,"A very spacious and spotlessly clean apartment, it holds special charm with bare brick walls and wooden floors with plenty of seating and a very large bed with a well equipped dressing room.  The bathroom is great with a very impressive bath for easing away the muscles after a long day of exploring.  We didn’t use the kitchen much apart from making a hot drink as we ate out most of the time but there is a great health food shop just opposite and a food shop just by the subway station.  Although we didn’t get to meet Jeremey his communication with us was superb.",1.0
Chicago,"Jeremy’s place is amazing, not only is it huge, it has everything you need for a comfortable stay, it’s in a great location for getting around town (literally one minute walk from the blue line at Division), and really easy to get to on the blue line from O’hare airport.  Jeremy was a fantastic host, very quick to respond to any queries we had, and was kind enough to let us leave our bags for a couple of hours while we went for brunch before heading back to the airport.  I would highly recommend his apartment to anyone wanting to explore Chicago.",1.0

Chicago,"Jeremey’s place is so beautiful, a perfect loft you could imagine with a view to a quiet street. It has lots of light, in the morning or in the evening too. Subway is 1 minute walking distance (literally)! Fire station in the adjacent building is not bothering at all, they turned out to be the most quiet neighbors we ever had :) Many thanks to Jeremey, we would like to return!",1.0
Chicago,Beautiful apartment thats is decorated to perfection. Its conveniently located (10 min walk to wicker park and 20 min subway to downtown). Jeremy was very accommodating and his local coffee & donut tips were great!,1.0
Chicago,"Rob’s place was beautiful! It looked exactly as advertised. The apartment was spacious & stylishly decorated. Lots of restaurants & bars within walking distance, as well as a grocery store. Rob was super responsive & hospitable. We were not able to check in before 3, but he allowed us to leave our luggage in his store prior to check in & even took it upstairs to the apartment for us! The only downside was that the bedroom can get a little warm, especially on a hot summer day. Other than that, we fully enjoyed our stay. Would definitely stay here again!",1.0
Chicago,"Rob’s Place was beautifully furnished and decorated. It was also only a 3 minute walk from the nearest bus stop which can take you to downtown or any of the metro/L lines - very convenient. The only downside is that there is no air conditioning in the bedroom so it got really hot. It is also on the 3rd floor so that’s something to consider if you don’t like taking the stairs. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and would recommend it!",1.0
Chicago,Rob's place is immaculate! I have never seen an Airbnb so tastefully decorated and cozy. Its in the middle of a bustling restaurant and shopping district but is surprisingly quiet. Rob himself was very responsive and a great host. I would definitely come back here for sure. Make sure you take advantage of the $20/day parking that Rob offers. It was a lifesaver.,1.0
Chicago,"My experience could not have been better. This was the mog immaculate, stylish, modern, and comfortable AirBnB experience I've ever had. The owner has spared no expense, from stainless steel alliances to remodeled bathrooms and showers, to new wood flooring. The temper-pedic bed was heavenly, and the furnishings were modern and comfortable. The attention to detail was unparalleled, from train maps and restaurant guides to Chicago artwork and plenty of cooking utensils and supplies, as well as beauty and hygiene products. I was beyond impressed with the level of care and consideration.   When I return to Chicago in the future, this will be my first choice. Always.",1.0
Chicago,We were In Chicago to see Hamilton and sightsee with our teenaged daughter. We loved this location and neighborhood. It felt safe and there were tons of nearby places to eat or get groceries. The condo itself was extremely clean and was well stocked with necessities. It was spacious and we never felt crowded. Rob was a great host and was very responsive to our questions. It was a plus to have  parking available as we never moved our car until we left Chicago. I would definitely rent from Rob again,1.0
Chicago,"Rob's place is incredibly stylish, supremely located, and overall provides a comfortable, beautiful perch from which to explore the city of Chicago.

Chicago,"This place is a fantastic stay!  Everything is wonderfully decorated, well thought-out, very clean, and it has an authenticity you can only find in a beautiful historic building.  The location is great as well. It’s a 13 minute drive to downtown Chicago, and 500 feet from the best breakfast place in town “Whisk”. You must go there!  Only thing missing in the Airbnb was coffee, so you may want to bring your own. But they have multiple ways to make it if you do.  Great stay, highly recommend this Airbnb!",1.0
Chicago,My wife and I came in to Chicago for our wedding anniversary and are so glad we chose to stay with Rob.  Probably the best Airbnb experience we’ve had.  He really thinks of everything and we can’t recommend staying here enough.,1.0

Chicago,"By far-this Rob's place is the most STUNNING home my husband and I stayed in. The décor is stylish, modern and pure class. The Holiday decorations made it festive and cozy. I really want those flocked trees!! LOL Absolutely gorgeous. The pictures of this listing does it NO JUSTICE!! Rob is a delight and one of thee most gracious hosts I have encountered. His level of hospitality is unparalleled and he gave us some great suggestions of local eateries in the area. His home is in great proximity to downtown and other neighborhoods. We truly could not be more pleased and dreaded leaving to return back to our home state. However, we will certainly be back and definitely in the process of making plans to book Rob's home again. You will not be disappointed!! Truly his home is a GEM!!!",1.0

Chicago,"This was the cleanest Airbnb we’ve ever stayed in. If you are picky with finding a clean place that actually FEELS clean, this home is for you. You can immediately tell that Rob takes pride in his apartment and everything is so well maintained and stylishly decorated. The bed was a welcomed place for rest after a long day, and we loved how firm the mattress was and how fluffy the pillows were—very comfortable.  The amenities were spot on, the coffeemaker, the gas stove, plenty of dishes and quality cookware to use for making a meal. Not mention, the exceptional decor of the entire apartment! The location was excellent and walkable to numerous local restaurants and bars (a few were literally steps from the apartment door). We loved being on the third floor and always felt super safe. There is some traffic noise that can be heard in the bedroom, but Rob provides earplugs for light sleepers. In truth, we actually enjoyed being lulled to sleep by the sounds of the city and it didn’t bother us at all. The convenience of the grocery store being a 5 minute walk away made buying some pantry and fridge essentials easy. The couch in the living room was super comfy and perfect for relaxing and watching the Thanksgiving Day parade and some Netflix Christmas movies. This was the perfect Airbnb and we were highly impressed (not always easy). 5 stars to Rob for such an amazingly clean, comfortable, stylish, and well thought out home away from home. We’ll be back soon!",1.0
Chicago,"This place is so much nicer in person! And wow the bed was so comfortable we ended up sleeping the first night we got there instead of going out because we got trapped in the bed lol. Communicating with Rob was very easy and his home was supplied with everything!! First aid kit, make up remover wipes you name it lol. The home is in a very quiet and safe neighborhood. Would definitely stay again, one of the nicest places I have ever stayed!",1.0
Chicago,"We had a short but wonderful stay at Rob's place for a weekend trip to Chicago. Communication and check-in were quick and easy, and it was a breeze to get there from the airport on the train and a bus.  The space was spotlessly clean and beautifully furnished, with thoughtful touches that made our stay really comfortable. The location is great too, with a grocery store nearby and lots of good food/drink options as well.  Our only regrets are that we didn't stay here longer to enjoy it more and that we had to catch a Sunday morning flight before we could peruse the beautiful store downstairs some more. We would definitely stay here again, and will happily recommend it to any family and friends who may be looking for a place to stay in Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"Rob’s apartment was exactly what we need for a wonderful stay in Chicago. It was styled beautifully and Rob provided everything we could possibly need- thought of everything!

Chicago,"This might be my favorite Airbnb stay to date. The apartment so stunning, clean, and comfortable and charming Ukrainian Village with so much to offer, we chose to make fewer trips into the heart of the city to spend more time enjoying and exploring the immediate surroundings both in and out of the apartment. Yoga, restaurants, shops, grocery...everything within walking distance and this little oasis to temporarily call home. Rob couldn’t have been a better host. Will be back for sure!",1.0
Chicago,Rob’s place was amazing. Right in the center of everything. The location was close to many restaurants and bars. It is also a short ride to surrounding neighborhoods and downtown. The place itself was amazing with all the amenities needed for a great stay. Rob was prompt in his communication and was right below if needed. The parking space was a bonus as it is hard to find parking in this neighborhood without a permit.,1.0
Chicago,"Location, atmosphere, beautiful decor, every thought to amenities (even a First Aid Kit!)... you simply can't go wrong with this great condo in Ukrainian Village.  It was a snowy weekend so we especially enjoyed the cabinet full of games!  We were visiting family in Streeterville and getting there was no problem at all.  Rob greeted us when I arrived, and check-out was very simple.  Also, my brother drove over from a neighboring city to meet me, so we appreciated the off-street parking for him and his daughter.  Stay with Rob!  You won't regret it.",1.0
Chicago,"This is a stylish, modern yet comfortable apartment located in a cool part of town with lots of options to dine and a young at heart hip vibe.

Christopher was very quick to respond and respected our privacy.

Very clean and in a great location. 10/10 would recommend!",1.0
Chicago,"This was our first AirBNB and I gave 5 stars all the way through. Chris was an amazing host. Quick responses and clear communication. Super helpful with us as we learned to navigate city, food and parking. Being from a rural area, we were grateful to have the help! Maps on fridge. Nice residential area, felt safe even at night. Extremely clean. Special touches such as video games and snacks. Went above and beyond to provide a welcoming and safe environment. Room was stylized, modern. Plenty of amenities, even access to laundry. If we make our way back to town, we’ll stay here again. Thank you for making our first AirBNB memorable!",1.0
Chicago,"Great place to stay! Very clean and convenient to food and shops! Reminded me of being Ina little apartment. The shower was a bit small, so if you're a larger person it may be difficult to fit. But it was a very nice place and the host were quick to respond.",1.0
Chicago,My husband and I love coming to Christopher’s place! Traveling to a larger city can be intimidating at times but Christopher is very knowledgeable about the area and has some general directions and maps ready for the guest. We will definitely be back to visit.,1.0
Chicago,"Christopher’s place was better than than described. He was also very accommodating and responsive. I’m not from here so the snow really changed some of our plans, but his home definitely made up for it. It was cozy and all the touches made us feel right at home. 11/10 would recommend!",1.0

Chicago,"We absolutely loved our say in Christopher's place. While it is a basement space, it has all the privacy you need including your own entrance. The decor is fantastic and we loved many of the little touches including the board games, tasteful art, game systems, and the water and drinks in the fridge were a welcome surprise after our evening arrival. Having central heat as well as a space heater in the unit helped make sure we stayed nice and toasty during our visit. We didn't take advantage of them, but the fact that a washer and dryer were available was a nice bonus.   We'll definitely look here first on our next trip to Chicago!",1.0

He has snacks and beverages in the fridge. there is also a full kitchen for those wishing to stay long term.,1.0
Chicago,"What a gem! Christopher’s place was exactly as described including a ton of extras. Christopher was quick to respond before and during my stay. He left a light on for me the night I arrived since I had a super late flight. He even checked in on me the next day to make sure I had everything I needed. The place was totally spotless. The bed was very comfy and there were tons of extra pillows. The kitchen was fully equipped and he even stocked it with several quick food items. These were much appreciated especially the first morning. The space felt so much more roomy than I was expecting. Ceilings are a bit lower being a garden unit but I had no problem at all with it. The water pressure in the shower was really great. Christopher made a really detailed welcome guide with lots of great info abt the neighborhood. The studio is only 3 short blocks away from a bus that takes you directly to the belmont el station (abt a 20-30 min ride). I felt very safe in the neighborhood (family vibe) even when coming in using transit late at night by myself. If you are wanting to do a lot of things in the Loop, transit took me 45-hour sometimes depending on the time of day. This was not a big deal for me bc I wanted a neighborhood experience vs more of a downtown touristy one, but it did take longer to get to and from. Lastly, Christopher was kind enough to  hold my luggage for me on my last day since I had a later flight. All in all, fantastic experience and I highly recommend this listing. Thank you so much, Christopher!",1.0
Chicago,Christopher’s place was was everything I could have hoped for. It was a nice cozy place where my girlfriend and I felt immediately at home.

Chicago,This is such a great place to stay! Awesome location between the airport and downtown. Uber’s were always there within 5 minutes and were reasonably priced for a ride to anywhere in the city.

Chris was very responsive and was flexible with check in/check out times in relation to our flights. The accommodations were more than we were expecting! Highly recommend!,1.0

Chicago,"I very much enjoyed Chris and Paul's home. The decor was nice, they had local food suggestions, snacks and drinks, and plenty of towels. Chris was always quick to respond and very helpful.

I would definitely recommend this air bnb.",1.0
Chicago,"Christhopher's and Paul's place are great Host my girlfriend and I could not ask for more. We were delighted by the apples and other goodies the host provide for their guest.

Transportation was nearby and made our rides to the city very convinient, also we got to explore more of it by using transportation. Chris and Paul were very effective communicators they responded within a few minutes of us sending a message. We will definetely book again  when we go back to visit our family in the Chicago area. Thanks again Chris and Paul!!!",1.0
Chicago,"We found this to be a much better alternative to expensive hotels. This apartment was private, quiet, and clean. Parking on the street was easy. Chris was very helpful and communicative. The water in the fridge was appreciated! We only stayed one night, but this place has everything you'd need for an extended stay. ",1.0
Chicago,Chris was an amazing host.  His place was very clean and better than we expected.  This was the wife’s first time visiting Chicago and she wasn’t disappointed as this place offers a lot of space for two guests.  Parking on the same street was hit and miss but that can be expected for a big city.  We took Lyft anytime we were visiting downtown Chicago.  It was nice to come and go as we pleased.  Chris responded very quickly to any messages that were sent.  I felt safe enough walking in the general neighborhood.  When we visit Chicago again this would definitely be the first choice.  Our first host cancelled which brought us to finding this gem.,1.0
Chicago,Could not have asked for a better space and location.  Outstanding customer service and friendliness from Chris.  Plus the money we spent even with Uber was less than half the cost of a hotel.  If I could give more than 5 stars I would.,1.0
Chicago,"Chris was a great host.  Nice touches like beverages and snacks in the fridge, full compliment of toiletries, etc.  Bed was firm and super comfortable for a convertible type sofa.

His place is a couple of miles from my daughter and definitely more convenient, comfortable, and affordable than any nearby hotel.",1.0

Chicago,"I can't give Christopher enough praise! This was absolutely perfect for our first trip to Chicago and the basement studio was just wonderful! Not only was it incredibly clean, stocked with snacks and home-y touches, but it was very comfortable and Christopher was an amazing host. He was very open to helping us with our bags when we were a little early to check in and he held them for us so we could go explore the city and enjoy our visit.

Good location in a residential neighbourhood, about 10-15 min walk to the local Aldi and 10 mins to shops, including the currency exchange to get bus tickets. 5 mins walk from the bus stop that takes you to the blue line, which then takes you to O'hare airport or downtown.

Chicago,"Samantha & Jonathan's loft was exactly as pictured, and located in a convenient location. I loved the apartment - I would love to live here myself! The stairs to the loft was quite steep as others describe, and I left my suitcase downstairs and only went upstairs to sleep. The bed was very comfortable. My friend whom I stayed with wanted an easy access to the bathroom during night, so she decided to use the air mattress downstairs, which we found in the closet (we moved furnitures around to make space). The walk to the California CTA station was 15-20 min for me, but since it was quite a cold week, I often opted for Uber. As we had packed plans in downtown, we did not get to explore much of the neighborhood nor get to ask for neighborhood tips that Samantha was happy to share, but I'd love to come back to this loft and explore more!",1.0
Chicago,"The loft is located in a great quiet spot that is walking distance from great restaurants and bars. It was a ~15 minute walk from both the Logan Square and California blue line stops, and extremely close to tons and tons of good restaurants and bars (check out Lula, Giant, and Longman & Eagle). Samantha was a great host and the place was spotless when we arrived, with tea and some nice snacks sitting on the table. Checking in and out was as easy and quick as it gets, and we appreciated Samantha periodically messaging us to check on our experience. We would stay here again in a heartbeat. Our only warning is that all the stairs in the building are extremely steep and narrow. We didn't have any problems, but you should be careful. Overall a 5/5 experience.",1.0
Chicago,"The space is exactly as pictured.  Simple, basic, perfect for one or two people.  The bed in the loft was comfortable and the HDTV had plenty of premium channels.

Major bus line is 3 blocks away that will take you straight to the northside Fullerton train stops and the Blue Line station that goes to the loop is about 8 blocks away.  The host is easily reached and communication was great.  Thanks!",1.0

Samantha and Jonathon provided us with a great list of nearby places do eat and drink (from fresh coffee to pizza) and were very helpful in communicating when we asked for help.   Logan Sqaure itself is a lovely leafy neighbourhood around half an hr from Downtown on the train. There's plenty of amenities a short walk from the appartment, as well as loads of great bars. A taxi into Downtown is quicker but more expensive.   The 'L' (elevated train) is a 15-20 min walk from the appt and then a further 15 min or so ride into downtown where there is plenty to do. A weekly ticket for the train is around $30 and gives you access to trains and buses. Very handy for getting around as the bus and L system is easy to use.  On a clear day, we would recommend hiring a bike and taking the Lake Shore route which runs alongside Lake Michigan. You get stunning views of the iconic skyscrapers from across the water.  Hancock Tower on a clear day is also a must see too, with great views for miles.  If the weather is cooler, then there are loads of great museums to visit. the History of Chicago by Lincoln Park is great. The Old Town is nearby for a drink afterwards too.  Definitely a great city to visit with lots to do, and a great appartment in a great neighbourhood. 10/10  Thanks",1.0
Chicago,"The apartment was lovely, clean, and the coffee/snacks were appreciated. The security within the apartment was great, and although the surrounding area was less confidence-inspiring, she had us send a photo of our car once we arrived, and the area had cameras, so it put me at ease. We were super close to both bus and train options that we utilized several times, and within walking distance of target for quick pick-ups. We enjoyed our stay!",1.0
Chicago,"Kay is the best superhost you will ever have!! She is great with communication and is very welcoming! Her apartment has a home-like feeling that will make your vacation even better. Cleanest place ever!! Absolutely spotless and smells amazing!!  If you are looking for suggestions of where to eat and shop, Kay will give you a list of her favorite places and provides a variety brochures, pamphlets, flyers, and food menu’s! I had mentioned my family was vegan and she gave me options of food choices around the area!  Great location!!! I highly recommend staying at Kay’s place if you are visiting Chicago!!",1.0
Chicago,"Kay’s place was very cute and clean!! She was super quick to respond to anything. The train is a quick walk from the apartment though I don’t think I would personally feel safe walking from the train tooo late at night as a young lady. Loved how she  had treats available like bananas, it’s, orange juice, coffee. It is very convenient for a quick trip to downtown Chicago!",1.0
Chicago,"Even though Kay's place was more on the south side of Chicago and I was going to the north side for a Cubs game, her place was great for a one-night stay with how reasonably priced it was right before Memorial Day weekend. I just got ubers to get to and from the game rather than public transit. Kay's place was very comfortable and she was a great host!",1.0
Chicago,"Kay’s place was amazing! Such thoughtful, kind touches, and Kay is super communicative. Seriously, this room was nicer and more well-equipped than some of the luxury hotel’s I’ve stayed at. 100% would stay here again!",1.0
Chicago,"From the extreme cleanliness of the apartment to the added extras everywhere you turn, this place was absolutely perfect! The host is respectful and generous with the most friendly senior kitty ever! Coming “home” to a snuggly feline in the living room was probably the best thing ever (I’m an extreme cat person). However, if you’re not into cats, no worries; the cat isn’t pushy and you could probably spend your entire trip ~not~ seeing him if that’s more your style. The off-street parking was clean and safe, something that can be hard to secure in Chicago. The apartment is located very close to both the train and the bus, making in-city traveling quite easy. I would highly recommend this AirBnB!",1.0
Chicago,It’s a wonderful and comfortable place to stay. Kay is really great at communicating with guests and is super nice and welcoming. The space is very clean and has a nice charm to it. We only stayed for one night but I definitely will keep this place in mind if I ever make it up to Chicago again.,1.0
Chicago,I extremely enjoyed my stay at Kay's place.  The location is perfect. My favorite part was having a Target with a Starbucks and market near by. This place is also closely located to a CTA and the freeway entrance if you have a car.  Kay provides many good ameneties and I was very happy for that. She is quickly responsive and super helpful. I'm glad I got to meet her. She is a sweet person.  It is 15 min away from the city.    Also if you have a rental/car there is parking near by!!!  Thanks Kay,1.0
Chicago,"Five stars isn’t enough! Kay made me feel very welcome and comfortable. I felt as if I was staying with family or an old friend, definitely not a stranger. She provided breakfast and coffee for me before I headed out and it definitely gave me a great start. I have a cat at my place, so their friendly lil guy made me feel even more at home. I would definitely recommend her to anyone else and will definitely stay with her again if the opportunity arises.",1.0
Chicago,"I was pleasantly surprised by how amazing the experience turned out to be at Kay's home. The entire house felt inviting and immediately puts you at ease. She puts the guest first and it shows in her thoughtful approach to outfitting the room. From soft bath towels and a loofah at your bedside, to the coffee and tea bar in the kitchen for hot drinks in the morning. She really wants you to feel like you are taken care of the moment you walk in the door. The location is convenient with good selection of restaurants in the area to choose from and downtown is a hop and a skip away for those who want to take in the sights. If it isn't obvious already,  I highly recommend staying with Kay during your trip to Chicago!",1.0
Chicago,"I stayed at Kay's place with two of my friends over St. Pat's weekend. The free parking was a huge blessing, and the apartment was very close to the CTA for local travel. The apartment itself was clean and well-kept. Kay was a wonderful host! From giving us travel recommendations to providing some St. Patrick's day accessories, she made our stay as enjoyable as possible. We also enjoyed helping ourselves to the coffee bar and playing with her adorable cat. All of our expectations for our stay were far exceeded and I would gladly stay here again.",1.0

Chicago,"Kay was a perfect host. She went out of her way to make sure I was comfortable and ensured I had everything I needed. Her place is so cute and even offers a breakfast bar with coffee, snacks and breakfast foods. She even left a loofa, towels and washcloths for me with chocolates. Also, there were loads of local brochures and magazines to browse. Her 16 year old cat Toby is such a love! He was super friendly and sweet. It was raining on the day I was going out to adventure in the city and I Kay was so cool about lending me her umbrella. She’s a kind soul and was so helpful with local tips for eats and getting around. Highly recommend staying at Kay’s!",1.0
Chicago,"Kay provided a great Airbnb! She was prompt in her responses and provided a few extra touches that made our stay very welcoming (water bottles in the room's mini-fridge, clear and prompt communication, breakfast items (although we skipped out on those), well-labeled instructions outside the door on how to get in as well as within the house to make things very clear, etc.)",1.0
Chicago,"Best Airbnb I've stayed in!

Kay was also super nice and accommodating. I would definitely stay here again and recommend to others!",1.0
Chicago,"Kay's place was perfect for me- free parking in a lot, close to the metro, and south (the direction I was coming from).  Kay is friendly, and her place is clean.  I'll definitely see if Kay's place is available the next time I  visit Chicago!",1.0
Chicago,Kay is an Amazing host with an air bnb that makes you feel at home! The entire house is sparkling clean and full of creative and cute decor. This room is spacious and fully furnished with all the amenities you may need. The check-in/out is simple with thorough instructions. The el (CTA train) is a short 5min walk in a safe neighborhood. This is the second time I’ve stayed here and both times there were other guests yet it was very quiet and comfortable stay and rest. Respect this space as it truly is a gem!,1.0
Chicago,Great stay. Kay’s place was in a great location close to downtown and public transportation. The room and bathroom were very clean and had nice touches. Didn’t meet Kay until the last night (my schedule) but she was very nice and personable. If definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone!! Thank you Kay,1.0

Chicago,"Kay's place was really awesome in a good neighborhood, easily accessible from public transport. Very highly recommended, especially for budget travelers like myself.   The apartment and room were cozy and I felt like being at home during my stay, with access to kitchen and living room area. The cat is super friendly too!   Kay as a person was a nice host. She even gave me some medicine upon request, as I was catching some cold from the weather in Chicago.   If I ever come back to Chicago I have a reliable place to stay :)",1.0
Chicago,"Kay is an absolute pro of a host.  She communicated check-in instructions very clearly and regularly  touched-base to make sure I had everything I needed during my stay.  Her place is ideally situated a mere 5 minute walk from an L train station (which is a fantastic way to get around Chicago as I discovered).  Very comfortable, clean, and safe place to spend your nights when visiting Chicago-- can't recommend enough.",1.0
Chicago,"The misfortune of staying at Kay's is that one will quickly realize that not every host will be like her! :-/ I was able to take the train (as she pre-stay suggested) directly out of midway and walk about 2 blocks & if cleanliness is next to godliness, then trust Kay has you covered. And to be completely honest, Kay extended herself to me in an act that goes way beyond the scope of AirBnb. I was comfortable, I felt safe, the room was very dedicated. Being that she was my 1st AirBnb experience,  I really feel like I lucked up. Omg, and her snack bar (fresh yummies), were too delish! :-* #BookHer",1.0
Chicago,"Kay is a fantastic host and I can not recommend her enough. When we contacted her for anything we needed, the response was lightning-fast! She was courteous and made her home warm and inviting for her guests. She really took a burden off our shoulders while planning a last-minute trip to Chicago. If you’re looking for a great experience for a really reasonable price, definitely book with Kay!",1.0
Chicago,"If I could give 6 stars I would. Kay's place was immaculate, cute, comfortable, easy to access — everything you could ask for in an Airbnb. Kay herself is an excellent and hospitable host, helping us out with umbrellas, breakfast, sunscreen, loofas — all the little things that shows she truly cares about making her guests' experience as amazing as possible. She is a gracious and generous person and I would 100% stay at her property again. ",1.0
Chicago,"If you don't like stairs or cats, that is the only reason not to stay here. Location is good, ample parking & light outdoors- ammenities are top & Kay is an awesome host with a BIG heart for her aging cat- that alone should make her 1st choice for any cat lover.",1.0
Chicago,Kay's place was absolutely amazing. She was a perfect host and made my vacation feel so comfortable. I was traveling alone and one late night she even messaged me to make sure I was ok. I think that was such an amazing gesture. The room and apartment was exactly as described and so comfortable. ,1.0

Stay at the Sprocket if you can!",1.0

We felt right at home. My colleagues and I kept looking around saying, ""I love this place. I don't want to leave"". On more than one night, we decided to stay in (rather than go out) just so we could enjoy the fire, movie, selection, and some homemade pasta!

As it was February in Chicago, we loved the fireplace to keep the space nice and warm. The flat was very clean, and stocked with towels and products for the shower. Danielle gave us a mega list of recommendations ahead of time, which was super helpful and full of cool restaurants and bars. The apartment is in Logan Square, and while we spent a good deal of time there and in places like Wicker Park, the freezing weather had us in lots of Uber’s downtown as well — just something to keep in mind. Though, it’s also off a subway line. Overall, no complaints, and Danielle’s communication was amazing. Would definitely recommend.",1.0
Chicago,I love love love Danielle's place.  It's extremely charming and well decorated. You can definitely tell she put a lot of effort into all the details of the apartment.

I would highly recommend staying here and will likely book it again.,1.0

Chicago,"This has got to be in the top two best airbnb experiences I've had. Danielle's place is so cozy and looks amazing. We ended up spending a lazy Sunday lounging inside by the fireplace and watching dumb movies - an ideal way to spend a day after heavy touristing Friday and Saturday. She was incredibly accommodating throughout our stay with complications our party had with check in and check out. The surrounding area had an incredible pizza place, a bar where we got boozy ice cream floats, some breweries, and way more that we didn't have time to discover because we didn't want to leave the fire. Will 100% look to stay here again in the future!",1.0

Chicago,This was a truly desperate search for a safe place for my daughter to stay last minute while out of town.  She made last minute plans to travel to Chicago for the Gold Cup soccer match.  Once there she could not find a hotel to rent to her because she is 18.  She was in her car crying.  I booked with Jim on the internet and spoke with him by phone.  He was so great!!!  He met her and her boyfriend at the door.  He even spoke Spanish with her boyfriend which made him feel great.  He assured me by phone about how safe the neighborhood  was and that he would be on the premises just a moments notice away.  He treated them like adults but still helped me feel comfortable about their safety knowing they will always be my babies.  It was truly above and beyond.  And my daughter said the apartment was gorgeous.,1.0

Chicago,"Jim & Maximo’s apartment is beautiful & well located. This was our 3rd visit to Chicago for a girls weekend; first time in Andersonville. Nice quiet neighborhood with Uber/lyft convenience to most city locations in 15-20 min. Apartment is on ground floor, some street noise but overall very quiet. Neighborhood is safe with quick walks to great eating spots. We recommend the little red wolf & mhenry.  Apartment is well furnished with nice appliances & conveniences, great WiFi. Host was attentive, but only needed on day 1: we’re pretty low key. Only recommendation would be additional blankets/ linens for pull out couch in living area.",1.0

Chicago,"Our stay in Chicago was great and we really enjoyed staying in Andersonville. It was far enough away to be quiet but only a 12-15 minute walk to the train station, which we didn’t mind at all. The neighborhood felt safe enough to walk in and we liked the local coffee shops and restaurants.   The apartment was nicely decorated and clean. I would just give a heads up that if you’re a light sleeper you can hear the hosts upstairs because it’s an old building. I would never take away a star for this because it’s just a personal thing. My wife is a heavy sleeper and it never bothered her but I had to download a white noise app on my phone to fall asleep.   The hosts were great communicators and asked if we needed anything and how our stay was going. We both enjoyed it and would stay here again!",1.0

Very clean, well appointed, extra towels and pillows, fantastic magazines for relaxing reading, GREAT map of the local neighborhood in order to find fantastic local shops and places to eat.  You can totally get around on public transit (mostly CTA Bus) from this apartment. Note: the place is a little far from the CTA train stations into downtown. We rented a car and really appreciated the flexibility to get around the city easily and great neighborhood street parking.   The apartment is well appointed with everything you need for your stay. One of the bedrooms is street facing but there is not much traffic so it stayed very quiet at night. Air conditioning for the summer time is a huge plus on muggy hot days!  Andersonville neighborhood is one of my favorite areas of Chicago. It is quaint, full of local  charm, great eats and drinks within walking distance, and a fantastic way to get a feel of what real Chicago is like (and not the fake touristy stuff). Off the beaten path geek thing we did - we drove to and walked through the nearby Rosehill Cemetery Mausoleum. The old original section has a substantial collection of LC Tiffany stained glass windows and walking the completely silent hallways to see the sun shining through these beautiful windows is pretty awesome if you like that sort of thing.  Love Jim's place! Beyond 5 stars! We will hopefully be back to town and rent out his apartment again in the future. ",1.0

I wish that we could have controlled the heat ourselves, but when the apartment started to get a bit chilly, we notified Jim, and he was able to turn on the heat for us quickly. Overall a great space and great experience!",1.0
Chicago,"Jim’s place is aesthetically pleasing, clean, and comfortable. It is in the lovely neighborhood of Andersonville and accessible to many restaurants and shops. I appreciated the clear communication, quick responses, ease of check in, and helpfulness when I needed to extend my stay. The house is well equipped with the conveniences and thoughtful touches that are helpful to a busy business traveler- a high quality iron and real ironing board, a washer and drier, toiletries, coffee etc.I would definitely stay at Jim’s place again.",1.0
Chicago,"We loved staying here! The place was beautiful, with many nice touches, a charming older building but remodelled with modern amenities, and sparkling clean. Getting in was very convenient, there were snacks left there for us to enjoy, parking on the street was easy, and Jim and Maximo always responded immediately to all of our queries, plus checked in to see if we wanted coffee, or needed anything else from them, checked on the comfort of the beds, and generally made sure that we had a great stay and felt well cared for. The kitchen is well appointed - the only thing not available was a microwave, but Maximo commented that he's about to get one for the apartment so that can be expected soon.  This is a great apartment with caring and involved hosts. I recommend staying here unconditionally!",1.0
Chicago,"The apartment was beautiful and very spacious. There are restaurants, grocery stores and pharmacies within walking distance. The neighborhood seemed very safe and we enjoyed walking around even in the cold weather. The Keurig and snack basket were nice touches which we appreciated. The beds were  too firm to be comfortable for me, but my boyfriend was fine with it, so it may be personal preference. Jim and Maximo were very attentive and always ready to help. Please note, the apartment does not have a microwave. Also, there is a policy that you cannot have any guest enter into the apartment (not just for sleeping, but for visiting too) which I misunderstood when booking, but it was not a problem since it was only the two of us. If you're traveling in a group or with family staying in other places, you may want to look for another place if you want them to be able to visit you. Overall our stay was lovely and we would recommend this apartment.",1.0
Chicago,"Location, location, location! The spot is located in a beautiful historic neighbourhood filled with lots of charm, great shops, and fantastic restaurants within walking distance. The space was incredibly clean, beautifully decorated, and had everything we needed for a great weekend. Jim was a great host and provided all the amenities we could have needed. 10/10 would stay here again!",1.0
Chicago,"This is a clean and beautifull apartment. Really clean and tidy, felt like home.  Close to coffee shops and general shops.  Jim and Maximo  checked up on me to make sure all my needs were meet and told me where the good coffee shops are. I highly recommend staying. I will deff come back in the future. 10/10 :)",1.0
Chicago,"This was my second stay at Ellie’s place, and I maintain that it’s one of the best Airbnbs ever! So quiet, clean, stylish, and comfortable. The tub is awesome and the coffee’s great, what more could I ask for?",1.0
Chicago,"Place was great! Clean, cozy, great location. Check in & out went seamlessly. LOVED the bathtub and shower. I would definitely recommend. The TV package was a surprising plus.. not usually one to hang out too much at a bnb- but after a day of drinking at Wrigley we were feeling a little rough-  it was so nice to just chill out the next day watching movies and ordering food! Loved it!",1.0
Chicago,"As a single traveler the studio set up was perfect for me. The location was great, since I had just been staying downtown at a conference prior to my stay it was nice to get out a bit and see some other neighborhoods. I could easily walk to the 606 Trail - which I really enjoyed - and N Milwaukee Ave for some fun shopping. I appreciated the guide they had in the studio with local recommendations listed, I got take-out from the Indian place down the street and it was delicious. Very comfortable bed!",1.0
Chicago,"Elinor went above and beyond to accommodate our stay, the level of hospitality was excellent!   The space is gorgeous and welcoming. I love that every detail was thought out, and this carries out throughout all the pieces in the home. Definitely a gem in the city.",1.0
Chicago,"Loved my stay here! Very comfortable bed, very clean, artistic space, thoughtful books and postcards, easy check in and out. Highly recommend staying here if you want to be in the Wicker Park area of Chicago!",1.0
Chicago,"I absolutely loved this place! I already told my sister that when we get the chance to go to Chicago together we will absolutely have to stay there. It was the perfect size and had everything I needed. The style of the whole place was gorgeous. I can tell a lot of thought went into creating this space. The shower and bathtub were amazing, and it was very helpful that there was a hair dryer, shampoo/conditioner, body wash, etc. When I do get the chance to travel to Chicago again I hope this is available. I can’t say enough about how much I loved this place!",1.0
Chicago,"From the incredibly easy check in and location, to the thoughtful touches that made us feel at home, to the impeccably curated style, we absolutely loved stayed here. It will be our go to any time we are back in Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"What can I say except that Elinor’s place was great! The little touches, such as welcome beers, pour over coffee, books on Chicago, and available toilet trees (we flew in and only had carry-one) were perfect. We only used the room for sleeping since we spent most of our day and night exploring the city! The weather is Chicago sure is unpredictable and crazy, so make sure you have a jacket or umbrella on stand by! Haha Thank you again for allowing us to stay in your lovely place!",1.0
Chicago,"We loved this place! It has all of the amenities and comfort of a nice hotel and more. The space was stunning, just like the photos. It felt very private which was great. We appreciated all of the books about Chicago and local restaurants. We’ll be back!",1.0
Chicago,This place is exactly as it looks! Super cute with personal touches so you know you’re getting an authentic experience. It’s close enough to the L to make traveling to and from the city accessible! Would for sure stay here again; wish I had more time :),1.0
Chicago,"OMG this place is so fantastic. It's PERFECT. I'm going to stay here again for sure! Great location, excellent host, so stylish and cool. The place also comes with an amazing little booklet to tell you how to use the WiFi and coffeemaker, and how to get around.",1.0
Chicago,"If I had more a sense of self-interest, I would write the  worst review ever so that this amazing space is always available for me when I'm in Chicago. First: it is it's own little building in the city. Wow! It's designed so beautifully, I took tons of photos to inspire my guest house back in CT. Elinor was responsive, accommodating, and super nice. I'm spreading the word to all of my friends who are jazzed staying there. The location is 10-12 minutes from downtown... well worth it for these gorgeous accommodations. BTW: the photos don't really capture the details and inviting sweetness of the place. I'll see you again, Elinor!",1.0
Chicago,"Ellie and Devin's space is charming! It's a well-designed, well-maintained large studio with incredibly thoughtful touches: books about the history of Chicago, more books from Chicago based writers and poets, games, postcards, and even stamps. I was a little nervous the first night with the studio being so close to the street, but I slept like a dream – the bed is comfortable and the studio is airy and bright. The place is exactly as pictured, even better. Ellie and Devin were very responsive and helpful. I would definitely come back and highly recommend staying here.",1.0
Chicago,This place is in the best part of the city! So easy to walk everywhere! It is clean with amazing amenities! The cute little touches! The great bath and shower! The delicious pour-over coffee! I want to stay there again.,1.0
Chicago,Elinor’s apartment is the perfect place for a cozy and stylish stay in Chicago. Everything we could’ve needed was provided and Elinor’s neighborhood recommendations were superb! I would highly recommend this place to anyone wanting to visit Chicago (and to avoid tourist traps)!,1.0
Chicago,"I can’t say it enough- this is THE best Airbnb I’ve ever stayed at and is so cozy! It’s worth every penny! I came to take my boards and it was just perfect for the stay. It’s so stylish, quaint, adorable neighborhood, and the little touches are unlimited! There was wine and beer stocked in the fridge, a cute pour over coffee pot and trader joe beans with a grinder! Basically I’m sad I can’t just move and stay in forever. People always say, “oh I’ll be back” but this is serious, I can’t wait to book again! I have best friends who live in the city and I’d still pay to stay in this awesome space! Airbnb MVP! Don’t hesitate! Book it now!",1.0
Chicago,"What you see on the photos are absolutely accurate and more! Loved the open space, high ceilings and obviously the bath. I've been using Airbnb for most of my travels and this is one of the nicest and most aesthetically pleasing location I have ever stayed at!",1.0
Chicago,"My fiancé and I were in town to celebrate our anniversary weekend. We couldn't have picked a better place to stay. The open layout, soft lighting, and claw foot tub all made it seem like a dream. Thank you so much!",1.0
Chicago,"Ellie was fantastic, super fast responses to my emails. Her place was fantastic, and right in the neighborhood where we needed to be. Hate to say this, but she could easily get more per night given the location and how awesome the space is.   Cheers!",1.0
Chicago,"Great place! Great host! We actually had major delays on our flight out of Chicago and she offered for us to stay another night. We felt loved and cared for. If you want a spot not in the downtown hustle but still in the city enough to Uber for good rates, look no further. Quiet neighborhood. Pictures described the space very accurately. It was the perfect space for a quick getaway to Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"Amazing and beautiful first airbnb experience. The place was decorated very modern and was clean. Both the walk in shower and claw-foot tub were great and the water got very hot. The bed was super comfy! There were plenty of towels, extra sheets, and blankets to use as well. There were also nice personal touches such as food recommendations and stocked beverages in the fridge (water filter, coffee, and some wine). Me and my boyfriend had an amazing time.",1.0
Chicago,"Wonderful place to stay while visiting the windy city of Chicago! Not far from great restaurant, bars, shopping and downtown. The coach house is decorated to perfection in mid-century modern decor and very clean. My husband and I used Uber all weekend and waiting no longer than 2 min. for a pickup at the house.  Highly recommend a stay at this location.",1.0
Chicago,"Great place to stay in Chicago. The space is very functionable and artsy, open and airy- we loved it. Comfy bed, all amenities you would want and then far more are provided. There are even beautiful post cards for you to write home with! Highly recommend it!",1.0
Chicago,Ellie’s place is exactly what you see in the all - no false advertising. It’s very light and open and she maximizes the space greatly. She’s very easy to communicate with. The Damen & Western L stations are close enough walk which we utilized a lot. Would definitely stay here again!,1.0
Chicago,"Gorgeous! I loved staying here. It was in a cool neighborhood and the studio was clean, styled well, and the bathroom was top notch. I want to stay here every time I come back to Chicago. They also have postcards and stamps for your use. Sweet little detail. Thanks so much!",1.0
Chicago,"This is a fantastic place. Super bright, extremely clean, great design, and extremely comfortable. Parking was easy. Check in and check out were super convenient and Elinor was very responsive. Can’t recommend highly enough!",1.0
Chicago,Eleanor's place was fantastic! Every detail was thought of including the courtesy postcards depicting her cat who sits in the window in the house on Artesian Street on the front. I would come back to Chicago just to hang out in this cool Studio for a weekend.,1.0
Chicago,"This is a gem of a space that is a close walk to some great cafes, shopping, and night life. As someone who travels a fair amount, I would say this was one of my favorite stays at an AirBNB. The space itself is very thoughtfully curated. ",1.0
Chicago,"There is a reason so many reviews start with how stylish the place is. That reason is because it is stunning and just as advertised! The level of detail and thought put in to the design is unbelievable.   Location is great, quick walk to the blue line. Check in/out is super easy, and the studio manual made our interactions minimal.   Great place to stay, will absolutely repeat.   Thanks again!",1.0
Chicago,"This place was great. It's worth the price just to swim around in that huge bathtub. Ellie was a great host, and the apartment had everything you could need for a great time in Chicago. I found most places I needed to go (food, cute shops, metro) to be about a ~10 min walk away, which I don't mind because I love to walk, but if you don't consider getting a car. It was really easy to get to downtown using the train. I have no complaints, this was an awesome  place!",1.0
Chicago,"This is such a cute, clean and comfortable space! I could stay here for weeks! Nice little neighborhood. Had initially worried about noise at night, but it did quiet down for a restful evening.  The fresh ground coffee, sodas, beer help to make it comfortable. Nice distance from downtown. Safe to run in the mornings with a park nearby. Love this place!",1.0
Chicago,"Ellie’s studio is absolutely stunning! She goes above & beyond for her guest! There are loads of local nicknacks laying around the studio to indulge into. She has her cabinets stocked with things one might need (ibuprofen, cotton swabs, razors, etc). The neighbor hood is very nice. There are not many of taxi’s in the area, so if you don’t drive one might want to download uber. Definitely worth the stay! Would definitely come back!",1.0
Chicago,"Fantastic stay! The studio was as pristine as pictured. You felt more like you were staying in a hotel than someone's home. Great amenities like shampoo, soft towels and even yoga mats! Would highly recommend,",1.0
Chicago,"Elinor's studio was a magical place, and I could tell as I soon as I stepped up to the door, because care was taken in styling the exterior with little faerie lights that sparkled. I hate to say this, but I can be a bit of snob when it comes aesthetic and decor. I have not one complaint about this studio. I was absolutely blown away. The incredible level of detail and design, even down to the studio's handbook was meticulous and thought out.  What's even more wonderful is the central location to all the haunts in the Bucktown/Wicker Park area. I drove and literally everywhere I went was less than a 10 minutes away. I can't imagine that taking public transportation would take any longer. If you do drive, Elinor provides a parking permit, which gives you the freedom to park anywhere in the vivinity without the fear of getting a ticket.  By far Elinor's place is one of the best spots I've stayed in for Air BnB. If you're looking for something magical and romantic (oh, I forgot to mention there's wonderfully restored claw-foot Victorian bath tub) look no further.",1.0
Chicago,Stayed here while visiting Chicago. The apartment was really clean and cozy and located in a really good location for our trip. We were able to park right out front for our stay and walk everywhere. If you're looking to spend time in the Ukrainian Village i would recommend staying here. Close to the train if ya want to travel other places too.,1.0
Chicago,"The initial observation of the space was of course a stylish space for a reasonable price.  Seeing the space in person is such an enjoyable experience - especially when noticing all the fine details not revealed in the online pics.  It is in those details that raises the level of impression and sets it apart from other spaces.    Elinor and I had minimal contact, but that was because instructions were clear on the check-in and check-out procedures, where to park, and even how to make the coffee - which we were thoroughly confused at first.    I enjoy exploring different places to stay when visiting areas, but I would consider staying here again on my next trip to Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"I enjoyed my stay at Elinor's studio apartment in Wicker Park.  The location was pefect for me.  The studio was quite stylish and had many personal touches, including a studio manual which I found quite helpful and fun.  I really appreciated the 2 bottles of wine and the beer selection in the fridge.  The kitchen was minimal but that was fine with me because I planned to enjoy Chicago's dining scene.  The bed was  very confortable, which was a definite plus.  The heater was somewhat louder than I was expecting, but that is the only concern I had.  I would definitely stay here again.",1.0
Chicago,"This is a great spot. Located near hip Wicker Park and related. Quiet, good access to Metro and very pleasant spot to hang out and do some work too. Hostess was very helpful on restaurants etc . This is a top BnB!!!",1.0
Chicago,"The space is exactly as described. Gorgeous. The bathroom is stylish, clean, and the shower is great. Would love to have a space like that in my own home tbh. They have cute touches throughout the studio, including Where Chefs Eat (I have that at home too!) and Studs Terkel's ""Working"" in the bathroom. The bed was really comfortable and once we figured out how to configure the NEST properly for our purposes, the temperature control was on point. One minor note is that both heat and cool air come out predominantly at the head of the bed, and it could be bothersome to people who are sensitive to dry air. My wife had to turn to the foot of the bed one night because she's super sensitive, but it didn't bother me much. The location was good for me because I don't need to be right downtown and don't mind taking a Lyft everywhere, plus I like to be in ""real"" neighborhoods. Puerto Rican restaurants abound as well as cool street art, if you care to venture around. It's about a twenty minute drive to many downtown area attractions. The hosts were very accommodating to my needs, as I had to cancel one day due to a family emergency. They were very easy to work with throughout. Will definitely look to return here my next stay in Chicago",1.0
Chicago,Elinor's place is close to perfect. Every corner of the space is thoughtfully detailed and styled. It's located very centrally to Logan Square and the Bucktown/Wicker Park area and I enjoyed walking the neighborhood in my downtime. Her communication was clear and extremely quick and I truly cannot say enough about how pleasant my stay was. Highly recommended.,1.0
Chicago,"Before I arrived, I loved the photos and thought the place would be perfect for my stay over New Year's. Walking in, it was somehow even better. From the furniture to the lighting to the tableware, everything in the space is very intentionally curated. I have a feeling the owners are designers; the whole place has a great aesthetic while still being comfortable. One of my favorite places I've stayed so far",1.0
Chicago,"We had a great stay at this charming, stylish studio. Clean digs and thoughtful touches like coffee, beer, and wine were lovely. Location was perfect for getting around town by foot or Lyft, yet the street itself was quiet and residential. Great host communication and simple check in and check out. Would stay again in a heartbeat!",1.0
Chicago,"I love this spot . The layout, decor and vibe are definitely hip. Everything is so easy + the communication with Elinor is on point. The amenities are great . The experience is very hommie , every time you discover little details that make a difference in your stay.   If you’re looking for something local, not loud ,  away from tourists this is definitely a good location.",1.0
Chicago,"Ellie’s place is so so wonderful! Chic, stylish, beautiful location from which you can easily access the trendiest Chicago area, Wicker Park. Ellie responds in mere minutes should you need anything and the keypad entry makes it so easy to come and go as you please, no need for keys! 10/10 would recommend and hope to stay here again! ❤️",1.0
Chicago,"Beautiful decor with so much space! Instructions for checkin were easy to follow. The coffee and extras were great!  Very comfortable bed! The apartment has an urban ambiance. Jeremy provided parking passes and we were able to find parking a block away. Communication was excellent. Jeremy answered any questions I had almost immediately. Neighborhood had a safe feel. We walked to local restaurants close by. One unfortunate thing, which was no fault of our host- when we went to leave, we discoveredthat our catalytic converter was stolen off of our car. I had driven our older SUV since I knew it would be parked for several days. Turns out, these are easiervehicles to get under and cut. I would not hesitate to stay here again.",1.0
Chicago,"This Airbnb is the best! Location and space are the key highlights! Jeremy has great design taste! Close to the train and many restaurants. We would definitely stay here again! If you’re visiting, try the rolled ice cream across the street! We had it twice!",1.0
Chicago,"The apartment was absolutely fantastic and everything was as good as advertised. The entire unit was much more spacious than it appeared in the photos which was a welcomed surprise as I have stayed in several Airbnb's that were smaller than photographed.   You could not ask for a better location, one block from the blue line which made traveling to/from O'Hare and into downtown a breeze. You're also within walking distance to countless top notch restaurants and shops.  Jeremy was a very responsive and accommodating host and he really made us feel taken care of when we had some flight plan changes. I would recommend this apartment to anyone wanting to visit Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"There is much to like about this apartment.  It's spacious, has full amenities, plenty of character, parking is included, and the place is clean.  Wicker Park is growing, has a unique vibe, feels safe, and offers options within walking distance for groceries.  The area also has many choices for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and drinks.  We chose to use the kitchen for breakfast, and the waffle maker was a great perk.  A critical factor in comfort, rest and relaxation is the bed.  While clean, we found the mattress to be uncomfortable.  It currently presents itself as firm and lumpy with indentations and sag from years of use.  Upgrading this one very important item would make this location, apartment, and experience worth renting again.  We enjoyed our stay overall and will keep this as an option in the future.",1.0
Chicago,"Came to Chicago for my cousin's birthday party. It was in my old neighborhood, so I felt very much at home. The place was spacious and exactly how it was described! I briefly meet Jeremy when I arrived, he was extremely nice. Would love to come back here when I visit Chicago again.",1.0
Chicago,"I loved this loft and everything about it.  The location was great - 1.5 blocks from the CTA - we were able to explore the entire city using public transportation.  Check in and check out were a breeze.  Jeremy was kind and offered great suggestions when we met briefly during the stay.  The apartment was spotlessly clean, comfortable, quiet and well appointed.  This was my first visit to Chicago and I would gladly stay here on my next trip.",1.0
Chicago,"We loved this place. It's spacious and very convenient. If you have small children, you may want to know that there is a firehouse nearby, but it did not bother us, we expected city noises. There's a Metro station barely a block away. It's great to have a washer and dryer right in the apartment since we tend to pack very lightly. We greatly appreciated the neighborhood parking stickers Jeremey provided and we easily found parking about 1 block away on a safe, residential street. We'll stay here again next time we're in town.",1.0
Chicago,"This is a large, 1 bedroom apartment within 2 blocks of the blue line. Very convenient! There’s a well equipped full kitchen with a small grocery across the street. Of course there a numerous great restaurants in the area so there’s no need to cook. The apartment was very comfortable and clean. We had plenty of pillows, blankets, towels etc. which was much appreciated.",1.0
Chicago,"This was my very first AirBnB and if all of them are like this one, I'll never stay in a hotel again. Jeremey's communication was excellent from start to finish and his home is so beautiful and immaculate. It is easy to find and right off the blue line. The home had EVERYTHING I needed and then some. He even left me 2 day parking passes for the area which made people coming by easy to park nearby. It is in a very cool neighborhood and as a single woman staying in an area I've never been, I felt very safe. When I visit again, I would definitely stay there again.",1.0
Chicago,Jeremey is a wonderful host and his place is extremely nice. He is quick to respond with any questions and is willing to give recommendations around the city. The place was clean and decorated with care. It has everything you would need during your stay.,1.0
Chicago,"Jeremy's apartment is exactly as advertised - stylish, large, comfortable and spotlessly clean in a very safe, hip neighborhood.  The kitchen has all you would need to fix your own meals.  We, however, opted to take advantage of the multitude of excellent bars, coffee shops and restaurants within very easy walking distance on Division Street and North Milwaukee Avenue (for lovers of high quality Nepalese / Indian food we recommend Cumin on North Milwaukee). Communication with Jeremy was very easy.  If and when we return to this part of Chicago Wicker we would, without hesitation choose to stay in Jeremy's place.",1.0
Chicago,"We were very pleased with the apartment. With an updated modern kitchen and bathroom we had everything we needed to be comfortable. Jeremy was a great host, communicated all details we needed when needed.",1.0
Chicago,Jeremy's place was fantastic! It is really big. Was great to unpack and have space and feel at home. Really close to the blue line. Easy to get anywhere. Felt safe in the neighborhood. Fire station next door but never bothered us or woke us up. Would definitely stay again!,1.0
Chicago,Our stay was great! Jeremey was very responsive when we asked him about accommodating our two dogs during the stay. There was even a small crate provided that we ended up using for the smaller pup. Everything was just as described and the apartment is close to many great restaurants and shops. We'd stay again! :),1.0
Chicago,"Jeremey's place is fantastic -- it's bigger than we were expecting and has a really nice overall feel to it.  It's nicely decorated and has all the amenities you would need.  Jeremey was very quick to respond to messages and helped out if anything at all was needed.  Check-in was simple and the building felt secure.  It's just a couple minutes' walk to the blue line, which brings you right into downtown in about 10 minutes.  Also close to some cool spots on N Milwaukee, like Oiistar, the amazing ramen place.  Super nice experience and we'd definitely stay with Jeremey again!",1.0
Chicago,"This was perfect for our needs.  Everything was as advertised.  It's a beautiful space and the location is great.  (Ashland itself is not too appealing but you're a one-minute walk from blue line, can stroll west on Division or walk up Milwaukee Ave to Bucktown.).  Self-checkin was super easy and we had everything we needed.",1.0
Chicago,"Jeremy was very responsive, answering all questions quickly and thoroughly.  His place was nice and very clean.  My parents stayed at the Air BnB to visit me and were quite pleased.  Being that I own and live in downtown Chicago, I can say that this location fantastic and the price to be a great value.",1.0
Chicago,This place is one of the nicest accommodations I have ever stayed at. Yes the price is expensive compared to a hotel but if you want a solid night's sleep and little slice of home be sure to check out Jeremy's place!,1.0
Chicago,Wonderful place.  We really enjoyed ourselves and relaxed at Jeremey's loft.  Very clean.  We enjoyed being able to watch people on the streets from the loft.  Love the mixture of cultures which we don't get much of back home.  Location was great.  Very quick walk to get to Wicker Park and many great local restaurants as well.  Felt very safe in the neighborhood and at Jeremey's place.  Super nice people.  Jeremey is fantastic at returning messages.  Always a quick reply and we had no problems at all that couldn't be fixed quickly.  Highly recommend Jeremey's loft!,1.0
Chicago,"Jeremey's apartment far exceeded our expectations.  The pictures don't do justice to how beautiful, stylish and very spacious this place is, not to mention comfortable and clean.  Everything was simply perfect.  Every possible amenity to make you feel right at home--we wanted for nothing.  Comfortable bed and couches, beautiful, roomy bathroom with large shower and plenty of hot water, fully stocked kitchen, excellent wi-fi and incredibly easy check-in process. We loved the location, merely 2 short blocks (roughly 3 min) walk to the Blue line on the L/ subway.  So easy to get to the main attractions downtown, but also in a great spot to explore the Wicker Park/ West Town neighborhoods and all the great restaurants and shops.  An excellent Airbnb experience--Thank you, Jeremey!!",1.0
Chicago,We found it exactly as advertised—perhaps even better. Super accommodations in a great location. Jeremey was very accessible and promptly responded to our requests and questions. We look forward to staying there again on our next trip to Chicago.,1.0
Chicago,We LOVED the location. The area seemed very safe and was central to the blue line and a Divvy bike station. (Tip: take the blue line to and from O’hare to save a lot of money on transportation) The apartment was very roomy and we enjoyed having access to a kitchen. Something to note is the TV does not have cable or “smart” access. We ended up buying a firestick so we had something to watch while winding down at the end of our days. Jeremy was quick to respond any time we had questions or needed anything! Thank you for a great stay!,1.0
Chicago,"Better than it looked online, a beautiful space with everything needed and then some. Great location, close to public transportation and wonderful local spots. Jeremy was attentive and helpful with all of my queries. Would stay here whenever I’m in Chicago. Can’t recom enough!",1.0
Chicago,"This is a beautiful unit in a great neighborhood in Chicago.  Jeremy was a great host and was easy to communicate with.  Check-in and check-out were a breeze and the apartment was spotless.  It's on a busy street but there was very little noise.  The blue line is a block away as are Target, CVS and a bunch of great coffee shops and places to eat.  Also super easy to pick up a cab or an Uber/Lyft.  Would recommend this place without hesitation!",1.0
Chicago,Communication was fast and easy and Jeremey was available every step of the way.    Apartment was better than I expected.  Great location and very close to the Blue Line which can get you just about anywhere.     Would absolutely recommend and would stay here again in the future.   ,1.0
Chicago,"This is a spacious apartment and very nicely furnished. The location is just a few minutes walk from the blue line with quick transportation direct to the heart of downtown. Check-in was easy and the host provided a sheet with lots of helpful suggestions for local eating places, of which there are many.  Staying at Jeremey's place for 4 nights provided a very comfortable place to stay for our tired bodies after spending our days exploring Chicago.",1.0

Chicago,"Couldn't have asked for a better place. It was super easy to get to and from both town and O'Hare, with a Blue Line stop only one block away. It was beautiful and cheerful as well. Loved the full kitchen and nice extra-large tub. Jeremey was a lovely host. I wish we could have stayed even longer!",1.0
Chicago,"Great location with convenient transportation. The neighborhood has a cool vibe. As a vinyl record collector, I was excited about being across the street from Dusty Groove and close to Reckless Records. Great overall experience.",1.0
Chicago,"My wife and I spent 2 nights at Jeremey's place. While pictures can often be deceiving, we were pleasantly surprised at how large and open the apartment was in person. It was perfect. Jeremey was traveling in Spain at the time, but he was quick to respond to questions we had the day of and during the trip about things such as checking in and adjusting the nest thermostat. We'd happily stay there again.",1.0
Chicago,Great space in a convenient location—a vibrant neighborhood and just a block from blue line. The apartment has a good vibe and personality and is very clean. Jeremy was attentive and responsive. I’ll go back.,1.0
Chicago,"Jeremey's apartment is really great. It's large and bright in all the right places (and quieter and darker in the bedroom, which is lovely for sleeping), stylishly decorated (without being overdone--the decor fits the urban space perfectly), has a fantastic shower, everything you need for a comfortable stay and is in one of my favorite Chicago neighborhoods, with a bajiggety restaurants, bars, shops, etc. The provided parking passes are super helpful, especially for weekend stays, because parking in this part of the city is no joke (in fact, if you can manage without a car, do, because you won't need it once you're here--everything is walkable, lyft/uber is plentiful and the El train is literally right there.)  If mobility is an issue for you, you should know that you have to walk up a flight of steep, narrow stairs to get to the apartment. Also, it's really in the real city, and real cities generally aren't that quiet, so if you're a super sensitive sleeper who needs deep, dark silence, you'll maybe want to bring ear plugs and/or a sleep mask.   But otherwise, I completely recommend this place. Jeremey is a kind, helpful and responsive host, the apartment is so lovely, and it's a really great value for Chicago, too.",1.0
Chicago,"We enjoyed our stay at Jeremy’s place. It's conveniently located, about 15 minutes to the loop and 20 minutes to Midway airport. Although we got around with Uber, the blue line is just minutes across the street. The apartment is super clean and lovely decorated. Jeremy is very thoughtful with the travel guide and tips. It was great to meet a Cal alumni at Chicago. =) I would recommend this listing to everyone.",1.0
Chicago,"This home was great. Jeremey provided easy check in details and instructions. The location was great because I was close to everything downtown and many shops and stores. I recommend this home and would certainly stay here again. Thanks again, Jeremey!",1.0
Chicago,"Jeremy was easily accessible for any questions via text and he even checked in the second day to make sure everything was okay. The apartment spacious, comfortable and centrally located. Just a few steps to the blue line CTA train, restaurants and shops. The neighborhood is busy so the provided parking permits were a huge plus.",1.0
Chicago,"This space is amazing. Plenty of room, furnishings are great, kitchen has everything you could need, and the shower was perfect after a long day of exploring Chicago in the cold. Jeremey was prompt with responses and great about giving me tips on places to check out. Literally just a few steps away from the Blue Line which made getting around the city super easy. I will definitely be looking to get this place again next time I am in Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"Great place! We stayed there with our 18month during our summer holiday trip, all three of us loved Jeremey’s place. Bigger than expected. Jeremey was very supportive and fast with all kind of questions. We can highly recommend this place, also when you are traveling with small children.",1.0
Chicago,"What a great stay in Chicago!!! Jeremey‘s loft is perfectly situated in one of our favourite areas within Chicago. There are so many things to explore in walking distance: restaurants, shopping, parks, and the great 606 trail. The train („L“, blue line) - which is more or less directly in front of the apartment - connects you directly with downtown as well as with the airport. The apartment is so cool, we would love to live there! Despite the busy street in front of the house the apartments inside is so quiet and we slept like babies. Jeremey is a fantastic host and helped us a lot to find our ways, gave us great recommendations and answered immediately whenever we wrote a message. We will definitely come again!!!",1.0
Chicago,"A very spacious and spotlessly clean apartment, it holds special charm with bare brick walls and wooden floors with plenty of seating and a very large bed with a well equipped dressing room.  The bathroom is great with a very impressive bath for easing away the muscles after a long day of exploring.  We didn’t use the kitchen much apart from making a hot drink as we ate out most of the time but there is a great health food shop just opposite and a food shop just by the subway station.  Although we didn’t get to meet Jeremey his communication with us was superb.",1.0
Chicago,"Jeremy’s place is amazing, not only is it huge, it has everything you need for a comfortable stay, it’s in a great location for getting around town (literally one minute walk from the blue line at Division), and really easy to get to on the blue line from O’hare airport.  Jeremy was a fantastic host, very quick to respond to any queries we had, and was kind enough to let us leave our bags for a couple of hours while we went for brunch before heading back to the airport.  I would highly recommend his apartment to anyone wanting to explore Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,We had a very nice stay at Jeremy’s Airbnb. Lots of space and a big kitchen. Jeremy responds quickly to questions and everything went very smooth. It is in a good location if you want to explore Wicker Park.,1.0
Chicago,"Really enjoyed spending a few days in Jeremey's place. Great location with Intelligentsia across the road, as well as La Pasadita and a good grocery store too. Warm, clean and cosy. Would definitely return.",1.0

Chicago,"This is a beautiful apartment, so wonderfully kept! Jeremy was a wonderful host and despite the fact that we had a mx up during checkout, he was patient and kind and just te consummate host. The apartment is wonderful, the area is well connected and I would stay here again In a heartbeat. ",1.0
Chicago,"Jeremey’s place is so beautiful, a perfect loft you could imagine with a view to a quiet street. It has lots of light, in the morning or in the evening too. Subway is 1 minute walking distance (literally)! Fire station in the adjacent building is not bothering at all, they turned out to be the most quiet neighbors we ever had :) Many thanks to Jeremey, we would like to return!",1.0
Chicago,Beautiful apartment thats is decorated to perfection. Its conveniently located (10 min walk to wicker park and 20 min subway to downtown). Jeremy was very accommodating and his local coffee & donut tips were great!,1.0
Chicago,"Rob’s place was beautiful! It looked exactly as advertised. The apartment was spacious & stylishly decorated. Lots of restaurants & bars within walking distance, as well as a grocery store. Rob was super responsive & hospitable. We were not able to check in before 3, but he allowed us to leave our luggage in his store prior to check in & even took it upstairs to the apartment for us! The only downside was that the bedroom can get a little warm, especially on a hot summer day. Other than that, we fully enjoyed our stay. Would definitely stay here again!",1.0
Chicago,"Rob’s Place was beautifully furnished and decorated. It was also only a 3 minute walk from the nearest bus stop which can take you to downtown or any of the metro/L lines - very convenient. The only downside is that there is no air conditioning in the bedroom so it got really hot. It is also on the 3rd floor so that’s something to consider if you don’t like taking the stairs. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and would recommend it!",1.0
Chicago,Rob's place is immaculate! I have never seen an Airbnb so tastefully decorated and cozy. Its in the middle of a bustling restaurant and shopping district but is surprisingly quiet. Rob himself was very responsive and a great host. I would definitely come back here for sure. Make sure you take advantage of the $20/day parking that Rob offers. It was a lifesaver.,1.0
Chicago,"My experience could not have been better. This was the mog immaculate, stylish, modern, and comfortable AirBnB experience I've ever had. The owner has spared no expense, from stainless steel alliances to remodeled bathrooms and showers, to new wood flooring. The temper-pedic bed was heavenly, and the furnishings were modern and comfortable. The attention to detail was unparalleled, from train maps and restaurant guides to Chicago artwork and plenty of cooking utensils and supplies, as well as beauty and hygiene products. I was beyond impressed with the level of care and consideration.   When I return to Chicago in the future, this will be my first choice. Always.",1.0
Chicago,We were In Chicago to see Hamilton and sightsee with our teenaged daughter. We loved this location and neighborhood. It felt safe and there were tons of nearby places to eat or get groceries. The condo itself was extremely clean and was well stocked with necessities. It was spacious and we never felt crowded. Rob was a great host and was very responsive to our questions. It was a plus to have  parking available as we never moved our car until we left Chicago. I would definitely rent from Rob again,1.0
Chicago,"Rob's place is incredibly stylish, supremely located, and overall provides a comfortable, beautiful perch from which to explore the city of Chicago.  As a host, Rob was incredibly hospitable and communicative, and was very helpful in getting me situated for the stay.  I highly recommend the apartment and would definitely stay here again!",1.0
Chicago,"This place is a fantastic stay!  Everything is wonderfully decorated, well thought-out, very clean, and it has an authenticity you can only find in a beautiful historic building.  The location is great as well. It’s a 13 minute drive to downtown Chicago, and 500 feet from the best breakfast place in town “Whisk”. You must go there!  Only thing missing in the Airbnb was coffee, so you may want to bring your own. But they have multiple ways to make it if you do.  Great stay, highly recommend this Airbnb!",1.0
Chicago,My wife and I came in to Chicago for our wedding anniversary and are so glad we chose to stay with Rob.  Probably the best Airbnb experience we’ve had.  He really thinks of everything and we can’t recommend staying here enough.,1.0
Chicago,Rob’ s space is 5 stars & beyond. He has gone the extra steps to make his guests well informed about the neighborhood & totally took care of everything you need to be comfortable away from your home. This Airbnb is the cleanest place we have ever stayed in.!!! You feel like you are his VERY FIRST guests! The photos give you a glimpse of the home but it out shines even those. Very modern & well appointed decor. His Christmas decorations were beautiful. He is warm & personable & communcation is outstanding. You will not be disappointed in your stay at Rob’s home!!!!,1.0
Chicago,"By far-this Rob's place is the most STUNNING home my husband and I stayed in. The décor is stylish, modern and pure class. The Holiday decorations made it festive and cozy. I really want those flocked trees!! LOL Absolutely gorgeous. The pictures of this listing does it NO JUSTICE!! Rob is a delight and one of thee most gracious hosts I have encountered. His level of hospitality is unparalleled and he gave us some great suggestions of local eateries in the area. His home is in great proximity to downtown and other neighborhoods. We truly could not be more pleased and dreaded leaving to return back to our home state. However, we will certainly be back and definitely in the process of making plans to book Rob's home again. You will not be disappointed!! Truly his home is a GEM!!!",1.0
Chicago,"The warmest home we've ever been in. Sparkling clean, modern and superb interior design, great location and a very lovely, warm host. Thank you, Rob and we promise to only stay at your place whenever we're in Chicago! An experience to remember!",1.0
Chicago,"This was the cleanest Airbnb we’ve ever stayed in. If you are picky with finding a clean place that actually FEELS clean, this home is for you. You can immediately tell that Rob takes pride in his apartment and everything is so well maintained and stylishly decorated. The bed was a welcomed place for rest after a long day, and we loved how firm the mattress was and how fluffy the pillows were—very comfortable.  The amenities were spot on, the coffeemaker, the gas stove, plenty of dishes and quality cookware to use for making a meal. Not mention, the exceptional decor of the entire apartment! The location was excellent and walkable to numerous local restaurants and bars (a few were literally steps from the apartment door). We loved being on the third floor and always felt super safe. There is some traffic noise that can be heard in the bedroom, but Rob provides earplugs for light sleepers. In truth, we actually enjoyed being lulled to sleep by the sounds of the city and it didn’t bother us at all. The convenience of the grocery store being a 5 minute walk away made buying some pantry and fridge essentials easy. The couch in the living room was super comfy and perfect for relaxing and watching the Thanksgiving Day parade and some Netflix Christmas movies. This was the perfect Airbnb and we were highly impressed (not always easy). 5 stars to Rob for such an amazingly clean, comfortable, stylish, and well thought out home away from home. We’ll be back soon!",1.0
Chicago,"This place is so much nicer in person! And wow the bed was so comfortable we ended up sleeping the first night we got there instead of going out because we got trapped in the bed lol. Communicating with Rob was very easy and his home was supplied with everything!! First aid kit, make up remover wipes you name it lol. The home is in a very quiet and safe neighborhood. Would definitely stay again, one of the nicest places I have ever stayed!",1.0
Chicago,"We had a short but wonderful stay at Rob's place for a weekend trip to Chicago. Communication and check-in were quick and easy, and it was a breeze to get there from the airport on the train and a bus.  The space was spotlessly clean and beautifully furnished, with thoughtful touches that made our stay really comfortable. The location is great too, with a grocery store nearby and lots of good food/drink options as well.  Our only regrets are that we didn't stay here longer to enjoy it more and that we had to catch a Sunday morning flight before we could peruse the beautiful store downstairs some more. We would definitely stay here again, and will happily recommend it to any family and friends who may be looking for a place to stay in Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"Rob’s apartment was exactly what we need for a wonderful stay in Chicago. It was styled beautifully and Rob provided everything we could possibly need- thought of everything! Only note to future guests is that it is on the third floor, so keep this mind when packing large luggage. I would highly recommend Rob and his apartment!",1.0
Chicago,"Rob’s place is one of the nicest, best located, and real value of all the places we have stayed!  It is tastefully furnished, very clean, modern, and had everything we needed to feel at home, including a fully-equipped kitchen.  Conveniently located to all the sites we wanted to see.  Also, close to a supermarket which was handy, and few steps to dozens of restaurants and cafes.  Rob was always quick to respond to my questions.  We highly recommend this wonderful apartment!  Looking forward to staying here next time we visit Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"The best place I’ve ever stayed at! Decorated to the 9s, home included everything I never even thought of - including band aids and bath salts for a lovely soak!

There’s a grocery store right nearby and nice shops and restaurants for a true neighborhood experience. I was in town for a conference and it was a quick drive or bus/train into the Loop. I will most certainly stay here again.",1.0
Chicago,"This might be my favorite Airbnb stay to date. The apartment so stunning, clean, and comfortable and charming Ukrainian Village with so much to offer, we chose to make fewer trips into the heart of the city to spend more time enjoying and exploring the immediate surroundings both in and out of the apartment. Yoga, restaurants, shops, grocery...everything within walking distance and this little oasis to temporarily call home. Rob couldn’t have been a better host. Will be back for sure!",1.0
Chicago,Rob’s place was amazing. Right in the center of everything. The location was close to many restaurants and bars. It is also a short ride to surrounding neighborhoods and downtown. The place itself was amazing with all the amenities needed for a great stay. Rob was prompt in his communication and was right below if needed. The parking space was a bonus as it is hard to find parking in this neighborhood without a permit.,1.0
Chicago,"Location, atmosphere, beautiful decor, every thought to amenities (even a First Aid Kit!)... you simply can't go wrong with this great condo in Ukrainian Village.  It was a snowy weekend so we especially enjoyed the cabinet full of games!  We were visiting family in Streeterville and getting there was no problem at all.  Rob greeted us when I arrived, and check-out was very simple.  Also, my brother drove over from a neighboring city to meet me, so we appreciated the off-street parking for him and his daughter.  Stay with Rob!  You won't regret it.",1.0
Chicago,"This is a stylish, modern yet comfortable apartment located in a cool part of town with lots of options to dine and a young at heart hip vibe.  I felt like a movie star in the surroundings & was happy to find out that the amazing shop below actually sold some of the items that are featured in the living space. It is located on an active street on the 3rd floor of a recently enovated building.  Rob is extremely responsive and a caring host.  I look forward to staying there again!",1.0

Chicago,"The apartment was exactly like the pictures, very stylish and comfortable to stay, lots of space, well designed kitchen with everything you needed. The bed was very comfortable.

The only concern was the road noise at night.",1.0

Very clean and in a great location. 10/10 would recommend!",1.0
Chicago,"This was our first AirBNB and I gave 5 stars all the way through. Chris was an amazing host. Quick responses and clear communication. Super helpful with us as we learned to navigate city, food and parking. Being from a rural area, we were grateful to have the help! Maps on fridge. Nice residential area, felt safe even at night. Extremely clean. Special touches such as video games and snacks. Went above and beyond to provide a welcoming and safe environment. Room was stylized, modern. Plenty of amenities, even access to laundry. If we make our way back to town, we’ll stay here again. Thank you for making our first AirBNB memorable!",1.0
Chicago,"Great place to stay! Very clean and convenient to food and shops! Reminded me of being Ina little apartment. The shower was a bit small, so if you're a larger person it may be difficult to fit. But it was a very nice place and the host were quick to respond.",1.0

The decor is fantastic and we loved many of the little touches including the board games, tasteful art, game systems, and the water and drinks in the fridge were a welcome surprise after our evening arrival. Having central heat as well as a space heater in the unit helped make sure we stayed nice and toasty during our visit. We didn't take advantage of them, but the fact that a washer and dryer were available was a nice bonus.   We'll definitely look here first on our next trip to Chicago!",1.0

Chicago,"What a gem! Christopher’s place was exactly as described including a ton of extras. Christopher was quick to respond before and during my stay. He left a light on for me the night I arrived since I had a super late flight. He even checked in on me the next day to make sure I had everything I needed. The place was totally spotless. The bed was very comfy and there were tons of extra pillows. The kitchen was fully equipped and he even stocked it with several quick food items. These were much appreciated especially the first morning. The space felt so much more roomy than I was expecting. Ceilings are a bit lower being a garden unit but I had no problem at all with it. The water pressure in the shower was really great. Christopher made a really detailed welcome guide with lots of great info abt the neighborhood. The studio is only 3 short blocks away from a bus that takes you directly to the belmont el station (abt a 20-30 min ride). I felt very safe in the neighborhood (family vibe) even when coming in using transit late at night by myself. If you are wanting to do a lot of things in the Loop, transit took me 45-hour sometimes depending on the time of day. This was not a big deal for me bc I wanted a neighborhood experience vs more of a downtown touristy one, but it did take longer to get to and from. Lastly, Christopher was kind enough to  hold my luggage for me on my last day since I had a later flight. All in all, fantastic experience and I highly recommend this listing. Thank you so much, Christopher!",1.0

Chicago,This is such a great place to stay! Awesome location between the airport and downtown. Uber’s were always there within 5 minutes and were reasonably priced for a ride to anywhere in the city.

Transportation was nearby and made our rides to the city very convinient, also we got to explore more of it by using transportation.

Thanks again Chris and Paul!!!",1.0
Chicago,"We found this to be a much better alternative to expensive hotels. This apartment was private, quiet, and clean. Parking on the street was easy. Chris was very helpful and communicative. The water in the fridge was appreciated! We only stayed one night, but this place has everything you'd need for an extended stay. ",1.0
Chicago,Chris was an amazing host.  His place was very clean and better than we expected.  This was the wife’s first time visiting Chicago and she wasn’t disappointed as this place offers a lot of space for two guests.  Parking on the same street was hit and miss but that can be expected for a big city.  We took Lyft anytime we were visiting downtown Chicago.  It was nice to come and go as we pleased.  Chris responded very quickly to any messages that were sent.  I felt safe enough walking in the general neighborhood.  When we visit Chicago again this would definitely be the first choice.  Our first host cancelled which brought us to finding this gem.,1.0

Chicago,"I can't give Christopher enough praise! This was absolutely perfect for our first trip to Chicago and the basement studio was just wonderful! Not only was it incredibly clean, stocked with snacks and home-y touches, but it was very comfortable and Christopher was an amazing host.

Communication and instructions were excellent, as was the price. We'd book this spot again in a snap.",1.0

I’ll definitely be coming back!",1.0

Chicago,"Chris' place is really lovely! Plenty of space for 2 people, with lots of thoughtful touches like biscuits, bottled water, tea and coffee etc! The kitchen was well equipped to make meals, and Chris quickly provided a can opener when we asked to borrow one. The washer and dryer in the apartment were also very handy. Good location in a residential neighbourhood, about 10-15 min walk to the local Aldi and 10 mins to shops, including the currency exchange to get bus tickets. 5 mins walk from the bus stop that takes you to the blue line, which then takes you to O'hare airport or downtown. It takes around an hour to get to the Museum campus, and about 45 mins to attractions like the Skydeck and Hancock Tower. Chris recommended an architecture boat tour which was fab. Communication was always fast and helpful, would definitely recommend!",1.0
Chicago,Samantha and Jonathan were excellent hosts !! They made my stay in Chicago extremely comfortable. The unit was very clean and fully stocked with everything you would need.

Chicago,"Samantha’s place was perfect for our short stay! It was very clean, stylish and cozy. The small, secluded patio was a sweet surprise. Only things to note- the stairs are very steep and the neighbors have a puppy, which was loud when we came in after a concert during quiet hours. Check in instructions were thorough and easy! We would love to stay again.",1.0
Chicago,"Samantha's apartment was clean, cozy, and had great lighting. She was kind enough to let us store our luggage when we arrived early.

Chicago,"Samantha’s place is modern cute chic. Every piece of furniture is well thought out with aesthetic and function in mind. The steps to the loft bedroom: first, it’s very roomy up there and cozy. The steps itself could be problematic for people who are afraid of heights but for someone like me who is uncoordinated, it was surprisingly easy to navigate. Although, I didn’t need anything, Samantha made me feel like she was only an email/text/phone call away if I needed assistance or info. Also, there’s a small but very cute balcony where u can enjoy your morning coffee.",1.0
Chicago,Fun spot to serve as base camp to explore Chicago as you can reach a bunch of fun neighborhoods inside of 30 min. The unit itself was extremely clean and Samantha was super responsive. The lock box makes check in and out simple. Added touches like the full kitchen and French press are a bonus. ,1.0
Chicago,"I had a great stay at Samantha's. The space was lovely and very clean. I didnt spend much time here because I like to explore when I visit a new place, but I appreciated the relaxing and simple vibe of the space at the end of a long day. Samantha and I communicated via text and I found her to be very kind and accommodating regarding a specific inquiry that I had. If you're looking and this place is free, book it now!",1.0
Chicago,"Samantha's place was the perfect place to explore logan square, we used to live in the city and hadn't done much exploring there. It's a great location, cute little apartment given you a sparkling clean, accessible place to rest your head after long days of exploring the great city of Chicago. Adorable and trendy decor! ",1.0

We got awesome suggestions on places to eat and drink and it doesn't take too long to get into the city. 10/10 would recommend!!",1.0
Chicago,"Samantha & Jonathan's loft was exactly as pictured, and located in a convenient location. I loved the apartment - I would love to live here myself! The stairs to the loft was quite steep as others describe, and I left my suitcase downstairs and only went upstairs to sleep. The bed was very comfortable. My friend whom I stayed with wanted an easy access to the bathroom during night, so she decided to use the air mattress downstairs, which we found in the closet (we moved furnitures around to make space). The walk to the California CTA station was 15-20 min for me, but since it was quite a cold week, I often opted for Uber. As we had packed plans in downtown, we did not get to explore much of the neighborhood nor get to ask for neighborhood tips that Samantha was happy to share, but I'd love to come back to this loft and explore more!",1.0
Chicago,"The loft is located in a great quiet spot that is walking distance from great restaurants and bars. It was a ~15 minute walk from both the Logan Square and California blue line stops, and extremely close to tons and tons of good restaurants and bars (check out Lula, Giant, and Longman & Eagle). Samantha was a great host and the place was spotless when we arrived, with tea and some nice snacks sitting on the table. Checking in and out was as easy and quick as it gets, and we appreciated Samantha periodically messaging us to check on our experience. We would stay here again in a heartbeat. Our only warning is that all the stairs in the building are extremely steep and narrow. We didn't have any problems, but you should be careful. Overall a 5/5 experience.",1.0
Chicago,"The space is exactly as pictured.  Simple, basic, perfect for one or two people.  The bed in the loft was comfortable and the HDTV had plenty of premium channels.  The neighborhood is quiet and we felt safe.  Parking on the street wasn't an issue for us, but it did seem to be full in the evening.  Major bus line is 3 blocks away that will take you straight to the northside Fullerton train stops and the Blue Line station that goes to the loop is about 8 blocks away.  The host is easily reached and communication was great.  Thanks!",1.0
Chicago,"I enjoyed my stay in this space! The studio itself was very clean and quiet during sleeping hours. The staircase to the bed was a little steeper than I had expected, but it was sturdy and I got used to it. It was in a lovely location that had access to buses and trains. I did do a bit of walking, but that was my choice. Samantha and Jonathan were quick with communication and gave suggestions for the area. I would stay again. Thanks!",1.0

We would definitely stay here again. Thank you!",1.0
Chicago,"Samantha's place is absolutely marvelous! It's located in a nice residential area, with some fun bars and restaurants in the neighborhood. If you don't want to wait for a bus, it's a bit of a walk to the blue line, but nothing bad. Uber rides into the city were not that expensive and an easy way to get into the city. The apartment itself is really, really nice. Clean, spacious and an extremely comfy bed. I would highly recommend it to anybody!",1.0
Chicago,A very stylish flat with lots of complimentary toiletries and helpful guide books for the area. The flat isn’t in the city centre but taking an Uber carpool is a cheap and easy way of getting into the main part.,1.0
Chicago,This is a beautifully-designed loft apartment in an upmarket part of town.  It is sparkling clean and has some nice touches such as local coffee. Communication with Samantha was very smooth and she answered our questions quickly.  I would highly recommend staying here in Chicago.,1.0
Chicago,"Lovely apartment in a great area of the city.  Local amenities were perfect (I'd recommend Tony's for any grocery requirement and Wyler Road for a chilled drink and a bit to eat!) and not too far from the ""L"" to the Loop where it's a 20 min ride in.   Hosts were great and very responsive to any request and requirement we had and helped out as much as possible.  The stairs up to the mezzanine are definitely steep but we expected this from the description so not a problem at all and the apartment is carefully thought out to give maximum usability of the space.  Overall a fantastic expperience of this amazing city.",1.0
Chicago,"Place was amazing! My boyfriend and I absolutely loved our stay here in this loft. Area is very clean and very stylish. All of our questions were answered very fast and accurately. Everything was supplied for us, they even had Q-tips lol. ",1.0
Chicago,"We had an amazing stay at Samantha's place. It is located in a quiet neighborhood within 20min walking distance from the blue line. The apartment is spacious and has everything you need including cooking facilities, big comfortable bed, tv etc. We were a bit delayed and arrived late in the evening, but Samantha was extremely kind by helping us ordering pizza while we were absolutely wrecked from traveling. Furthermore, she always responded very quickly to questions from us. We ran in to her husband Jonathan a couple of times who was also super friendly and gave us a ton of advice on what to do in the city. Overall we had a great couple of days in Chicago and we definitely recommend this place! ",1.0
Chicago,"Samantha's place was perfect for our weekend getaway. Travel around the city was very convenient with transit and biking options very closeby. The space was extremely tidy and comfortable, and our hosts were very accommodating...thanks for a wonderful Chicago experience!",1.0
Chicago,"This apartment is great! The apartment itself is already beautiful and special with its high ceilings, and the location is also very nice. In walking distance from Logan square, with nice coffee bars, restaurants, shops and street art. But also in walking distance from public transport that takes you to downtown in just a few stops. We would definitely recommend this place for a great visit to this great city",1.0
Chicago,"Lovely loft studio, spotlessly clean and very well designed with everything we needed. Location is good with the metro about 15 mins walk away then 20 mins to downtown, and a Chicago bike scheme station 5mins away and an even quicker cycle to downtown. We also enjoyed the 606 trail, Chicago's answer to the Highline which is also close by.  So a great place and a great location.",1.0
Chicago,Beautiful apartment in quite neighborhood. The space is great it's location relative to public transit is awesome. Samantha was quick to respond to any questions. I will definitely be checking availability next time I'm back in Chicago.,1.0
Chicago,"We had a great stay at Logan Square. The appartment was spacious (more so than we expected) and very clean with thoughtful provisions provided.   Samantha and Jonathon provided us with a great list of nearby places do eat and drink (from fresh coffee to pizza) and were very helpful in communicating when we asked for help.   Logan Sqaure itself is a lovely leafy neighbourhood around half an hr from Downtown on the train. There's plenty of amenities a short walk from the appartment, as well as loads of great bars. A taxi into Downtown is quicker but more expensive.   The 'L' (elevated train) is a 15-20 min walk from the appt and then a further 15 min or so ride into downtown where there is plenty to do. A weekly ticket for the train is around $30 and gives you access to trains and buses. Very handy for getting around as the bus and L system is easy to use.  On a clear day, we would recommend hiring a bike and taking the Lake Shore route which runs alongside Lake Michigan. You get stunning views of the iconic skyscrapers from across the water.  Hancock Tower on a clear day is also a must see too, with great views for miles.  If the weather is cooler, then there are loads of great museums to visit. the History of Chicago by Lincoln Park is great. The Old Town is nearby for a drink afterwards too.  Definitely a great city to visit with lots to do, and a great appartment in a great neighbourhood. 10/10  Thanks",1.0
Chicago,"The apartment was lovely, clean, and the coffee/snacks were appreciated. The security within the apartment was great, and although the surrounding area was less confidence-inspiring, she had us send a photo of our car once we arrived, and the area had cameras, so it put me at ease. We were super close to both bus and train options that we utilized several times, and within walking distance of target for quick pick-ups. We enjoyed our stay!",1.0
Chicago,"Kay is the best superhost you will ever have!! She is great with communication and is very welcoming! Her apartment has a home-like feeling that will make your vacation even better. Cleanest place ever!! Absolutely spotless and smells amazing!!  If you are looking for suggestions of where to eat and shop, Kay will give you a list of her favorite places and provides a variety brochures, pamphlets, flyers, and food menu’s! I had mentioned my family was vegan and she gave me options of food choices around the area!  Great location!!! I highly recommend staying at Kay’s place if you are visiting Chicago!!",1.0
Chicago,"Kay’s place was very cute and clean!! She was super quick to respond to anything. The train is a quick walk from the apartment though I don’t think I would personally feel safe walking from the train tooo late at night as a young lady. Loved how she  had treats available like bananas, it’s, orange juice, coffee. It is very convenient for a quick trip to downtown Chicago!",1.0
Chicago,"Even though Kay's place was more on the south side of Chicago and I was going to the north side for a Cubs game, her place was great for a one-night stay with how reasonably priced it was right before Memorial Day weekend. I just got ubers to get to and from the game rather than public transit. Kay's place was very comfortable and she was a great host!",1.0
Chicago,"Kay’s place was amazing! Such thoughtful, kind touches, and Kay is super communicative. Seriously, this room was nicer and more well-equipped than some of the luxury hotel’s I’ve stayed at. 100% would stay here again!",1.0
Chicago,"From the extreme cleanliness of the apartment to the added extras everywhere you turn, this place was absolutely perfect! The host is respectful and generous with the most friendly senior kitty ever! Coming “home” to a snuggly feline in the living room was probably the best thing ever (I’m an extreme cat person). However, if you’re not into cats, no worries; the cat isn’t pushy and you could probably spend your entire trip ~not~ seeing him if that’s more your style. The off-street parking was clean and safe, something that can be hard to secure in Chicago. The apartment is located very close to both the train and the bus, making in-city traveling quite easy. I would highly recommend this AirBnB!",1.0
Chicago,It’s a wonderful and comfortable place to stay. Kay is really great at communicating with guests and is super nice and welcoming. The space is very clean and has a nice charm to it. We only stayed for one night but I definitely will keep this place in mind if I ever make it up to Chicago again.,1.0
Chicago,I extremely enjoyed my stay at Kay's place.  The location is perfect. My favorite part was having a Target with a Starbucks and market near by. This place is also closely located to a CTA and the freeway entrance if you have a car.  Kay provides many good ameneties and I was very happy for that. She is quickly responsive and super helpful. I'm glad I got to meet her. She is a sweet person.  It is 15 min away from the city.    Also if you have a rental/car there is parking near by!!!  Thanks Kay,1.0
Chicago,"Five stars isn’t enough! Kay made me feel very welcome and comfortable. I felt as if I was staying with family or an old friend, definitely not a stranger. She provided breakfast and coffee for me before I headed out and it definitely gave me a great start. I have a cat at my place, so their friendly lil guy made me feel even more at home. I would definitely recommend her to anyone else and will definitely stay with her again if the opportunity arises.",1.0
Chicago,"I was pleasantly surprised by how amazing the experience turned out to be at Kay's home. The entire house felt inviting and immediately puts you at ease. She puts the guest first and it shows in her thoughtful approach to outfitting the room. From soft bath towels and a loofah at your bedside, to the coffee and tea bar in the kitchen for hot drinks in the morning. She really wants you to feel like you are taken care of the moment you walk in the door. The location is convenient with good selection of restaurants in the area to choose from and downtown is a hop and a skip away for those who want to take in the sights. If it isn't obvious already,  I highly recommend staying with Kay during your trip to Chicago!",1.0
Chicago,"I stayed at Kay's place with two of my friends over St. Pat's weekend. The free parking was a huge blessing, and the apartment was very close to the CTA for local travel. The apartment itself was clean and well-kept. Kay was a wonderful host! From giving us travel recommendations to providing some St. Patrick's day accessories, she made our stay as enjoyable as possible. We also enjoyed helping ourselves to the coffee bar and playing with her adorable cat. All of our expectations for our stay were far exceeded and I would gladly stay here again.",1.0

Chicago,"Kay was a perfect host. She went out of her way to make sure I was comfortable and ensured I had everything I needed. Her place is so cute and even offers a breakfast bar with coffee, snacks and breakfast foods. She even left a loofa, towels and washcloths for me with chocolates. Also, there were loads of local brochures and magazines to browse. Her 16 year old cat Toby is such a love! He was super friendly and sweet. It was raining on the day I was going out to adventure in the city and I Kay was so cool about lending me her umbrella. She’s a kind soul and was so helpful with local tips for eats and getting around. Highly recommend staying at Kay’s!",1.0
Chicago,"Kay provided a great Airbnb! She was prompt in her responses and provided a few extra touches that made our stay very welcoming (water bottles in the room's mini-fridge, clear and prompt communication, breakfast items (although we skipped out on those), well-labeled instructions outside the door on how to get in as well as within the house to make things very clear, etc.)",1.0
Chicago,"Best Airbnb I've stayed in!

Chicago,Kay is an Amazing host with an air bnb that makes you feel at home! The entire house is sparkling clean and full of creative and cute decor. This room is spacious and fully furnished with all the amenities you may need. The check-in/out is simple with thorough instructions. The el (CTA train) is a short 5min walk in a safe neighborhood. This is the second time I’ve stayed here and both times there were other guests yet it was very quiet and comfortable stay and rest. Respect this space as it truly is a gem!,1.0
Chicago,Great stay. Kay’s place was in a great location close to downtown and public transportation. The room and bathroom were very clean and had nice touches.

Chicago,"Kay's place was really awesome in a good neighborhood, easily accessible from public transport. Very highly recommended, especially for budget travelers like myself.   The apartment and room were cozy and I felt like being at home during my stay, with access to kitchen and living room area. The cat is super friendly too!   Kay as a person was a nice host. She even gave me some medicine upon request, as I was catching some cold from the weather in Chicago.   If I ever come back to Chicago I have a reliable place to stay :)",1.0
Chicago,"Kay is an absolute pro of a host.  She communicated check-in instructions very clearly and regularly  touched-base to make sure I had everything I needed during my stay.  Her place is ideally situated a mere 5 minute walk from an L train station (which is a fantastic way to get around Chicago as I discovered).  Very comfortable, clean, and safe place to spend your nights when visiting Chicago-- can't recommend enough.",1.0
Chicago,"The misfortune of staying at Kay's is that one will quickly realize that not every host will be like her! :-/ I was able to take the train (as she pre-stay suggested) directly out of midway and walk about 2 blocks & if cleanliness is next to godliness, then trust Kay has you covered. And to be completely honest, Kay extended herself to me in an act that goes way beyond the scope of AirBnb. I was comfortable, I felt safe, the room was very dedicated. Being that she was my 1st AirBnb experience,  I really feel like I lucked up. Omg, and her snack bar (fresh yummies), were too delish! :-* #BookHer",1.0
Chicago,"Kay is a fantastic host and I can not recommend her enough. When we contacted her for anything we needed, the response was lightning-fast! She was courteous and made her home warm and inviting for her guests. She really took a burden off our shoulders while planning a last-minute trip to Chicago. If you’re looking for a great experience for a really reasonable price, definitely book with Kay!",1.0
Chicago,"If I could give 6 stars I would. Kay's place was immaculate, cute, comfortable, easy to access — everything you could ask for in an Airbnb. Kay herself is an excellent and hospitable host, helping us out with umbrellas, breakfast, sunscreen, loofas — all the little things that shows she truly cares about making her guests' experience as amazing as possible. She is a gracious and generous person and I would 100% stay at her property again. ",1.0
Chicago,"If you don't like stairs or cats, that is the only reason not to stay here. Location is good, ample parking & light outdoors- ammenities are top & Kay is an awesome host with a BIG heart for her aging cat- that alone should make her 1st choice for any cat lover.",1.0

Once there she could not find a hotel to rent to her because she is 18.  She was in her car crying.  I booked with Jim on the internet and spoke with him by phone.  He was so great!!!  He met her and her boyfriend at the door.  He even spoke Spanish with her boyfriend which made him feel great.  He assured me by phone about how safe the neighborhood  was and that he would be on the premises just a moments notice away.  He treated them like adults but still helped me feel comfortable about their safety knowing they will always be my babies.  It was truly above and beyond.  And my daughter said the apartment was gorgeous.,1.0

Chicago,Our stay was perfect! Everything was incredibly clean and smelled lovely when we walked in. They responded promptly to any messages I sent. The modern touch to the retro atmosphere made the apartment feel both cozy and familiar. We weren't bothered by any noise in the neighborhood neither during the day nor through the night.

Chicago,"This place is lovely. It’s a very clean and well restored apartment.  The windows are about at ground level, so actually the floor of the apartment is 2-3’ below ground level.  We liked this, it felt cozy and being on the ground floor was very convenient. The design of the kitchen and living room is very nice, the bedrooms are comfortable and private. Took a few baths, nice bathroom. It was very quiet, almost no street noise. Just a few blocks from Clark street and a few more to the train. We loved staying here!",1.0

Chicago,This apartment is a very stylish and super comfortable place.  It is on a quiet street on the edge of the popular Andersonville neighborhood.  There are plenty of restaurants and bars which you can easily walk to along with some boutique shopping.   You are a quick walk to several CTA bus routes and a longer walk to the red line.

Chicago,"Jim & Maximo’s apartment is beautiful & well located. This was our 3rd visit to Chicago for a girls weekend; first time in Andersonville. Nice quiet neighborhood with Uber/lyft convenience to most city locations in 15-20 min. Apartment is on ground floor, some street noise but overall very quiet. Neighborhood is safe with quick walks to great eating spots. We recommend the little red wolf & mhenry.  Apartment is well furnished with nice appliances & conveniences, great WiFi. Host was attentive, but only needed on day 1: we’re pretty low key. Only recommendation would be additional blankets/ linens for pull out couch in living area.",1.0

I could not have asked for a better experience!",1.0
Chicago,"Our stay in Chicago was great and we really enjoyed staying in Andersonville. It was far enough away to be quiet but only a 12-15 minute walk to the train station, which we didn’t mind at all. The neighborhood felt safe enough to walk in and we liked the local coffee shops and restaurants.   The apartment was nicely decorated and clean. I would just give a heads up that if you’re a light sleeper you can hear the hosts upstairs because it’s an old building. I would never take away a star for this because it’s just a personal thing. My wife is a heavy sleeper and it never bothered her but I had to download a white noise app on my phone to fall asleep.   The hosts were great communicators and asked if we needed anything and how our stay was going. We both enjoyed it and would stay here again!",1.0
Chicago,"Jim's place is just as pictured and described and was a lovely, comfortable, clean and quiet place to stay while I visited family and friends in the Chicago area. The location is halfway between the main city and Evanston, which was perfect for me, and it was very close to some really cool restaurants/bakeries, etc. Had no trouble getting around and found parking on the street each night without trouble. Safe and quiet neighborhood. Jim and Maximo were very attentive and had supplied everything I needed for my stay. Would definitely stay there again.",1.0

Chicago,"Jim's place was FANTASTIC. The place was exactly what we expected it to be from the fabulous photos which were 100% accurate showing off the truly lovely and well decorated apartment. Very clean, well appointed, extra towels and pillows, fantastic magazines for relaxing reading, GREAT map of the local neighborhood in order to find fantastic local shops and places to eat.  You can totally get around on public transit (mostly CTA Bus) from this apartment. Note: the place is a little far from the CTA train stations into downtown. We rented a car and really appreciated the flexibility to get around the city easily and great neighborhood street parking.   The apartment is well appointed with everything you need for your stay. One of the bedrooms is street facing but there is not much traffic so it stayed very quiet at night. Air conditioning for the summer time is a huge plus on muggy hot days!  Andersonville neighborhood is one of my favorite areas of Chicago. It is quaint, full of local  charm, great eats and drinks within walking distance, and a fantastic way to get a feel of what real Chicago is like (and not the fake touristy stuff). Off the beaten path geek thing we did - we drove to and walked through the nearby Rosehill Cemetery Mausoleum. The old original section has a substantial collection of LC Tiffany stained glass windows and walking the completely silent hallways to see the sun shining through these beautiful windows is pretty awesome if you like that sort of thing.  Love Jim's place! Beyond 5 stars! We will hopefully be back to town and rent out his apartment again in the future. ",1.0
Chicago,"Great space to spend a few days. Neighborhood was a few miles north of the downtown area of Chicago. Very quiet but still had the Chicago city feel to it.

I'd recommend it to anyone looking to stay in the area.",1.0
Chicago,"Jim and Maximo were great hosts! This spacious two-bed, one-bath is the perfect getaway for family and friends! I picked Andersonville, because it's a great LGBTQ+ friendly neighborhood and was a great location to experience all of the Pride festivities happening over the weekend during our stay. Jim and Maximo were super responsive and very accommodating throughout my entire experience even before arriving for the weekend! The neighborhood is a family-friendly area and was very walk-able with lots of places to go for food, coffee or to go grocery shopping.

Chicago,"We really enjoyed staying at Jim's place over a quick weekend get-away to Chicago. It's very close to all the Andersonville shops and restaurants on Clark St. and a short walk to the el stop to go downtown; it's in a lovely, quiet, leafy neighborhood of brownstones. Parking was easy -- there was street parking right outside the apartment; we parked the car when we arrived Friday and didn't need to move it or use it until we left on Sunday. The apartment was very clean and well-appointed, with a great kitchen and nice amenities. Jim was there to give us the keys when we checked in; he and Maximo were available if needed but also gave us space. We'd highly recommend this one!",1.0
Chicago,"Stylish apartment in a great location with convenient parking and great restaurants/shops nearby. We really enjoyed our stay here. The kitchen had everything we needed to cook and prepare our own food. Jim was very responsive and accommodating, which made everything easy and enjoyable.

This is a great apartment with caring and involved hosts. I recommend staying here unconditionally!",1.0
Chicago,"The apartment was beautiful and very spacious. There are restaurants, grocery stores and pharmacies within walking distance. The neighborhood seemed very safe and we enjoyed walking around even in the cold weather. The Keurig and snack basket were nice touches which we appreciated. The beds were  too firm to be comfortable for me, but my boyfriend was fine with it, so it may be personal preference. Jim and Maximo were very attentive and always ready to help. Please note, the apartment does not have a microwave. Also, there is a policy that you cannot have any guest enter into the apartment (not just for sleeping, but for visiting too) which I misunderstood when booking, but it was not a problem since it was only the two of us. If you're traveling in a group or with family staying in other places, you may want to look for another place if you want them to be able to visit you. Overall our stay was lovely and we would recommend this apartment.",1.0

Loved it!",1.0
Chicago,"As a single traveler the studio set up was perfect for me. The location was great, since I had just been staying downtown at a conference prior to my stay it was nice to get out a bit and see some other neighborhoods. I could easily walk to the 606 Trail - which I really enjoyed - and N Milwaukee Ave for some fun shopping. I appreciated the guide they had in the studio with local recommendations listed, I got take-out from the Indian place down the street and it was delicious. Very comfortable bed!",1.0

First: it is it's own little building in the city. Wow! It's designed so beautifully, I took tons of photos to inspire my guest house back in CT. Elinor was responsive, accommodating, and super nice. I'm spreading the word to all of my friends who are jazzed staying there. The location is 10-12 minutes from downtown... well worth it for these gorgeous accommodations. BTW: the photos don't really capture the details and inviting sweetness of the place. I'll see you again, Elinor!",1.0
Chicago,"Ellie and Devin's space is charming! It's a well-designed, well-maintained large studio with incredibly thoughtful touches: books about the history of Chicago, more books from Chicago based writers and poets, games, postcards, and even stamps. I was a little nervous the first night with the studio being so close to the street, but I slept like a dream – the bed is comfortable and the studio is airy and bright. The place is exactly as pictured, even better. Ellie and Devin were very responsive and helpful. I would definitely come back and highly recommend staying here.",1.0

Chicago,"There is a reason so many reviews start with how stylish the place is. That reason is because it is stunning and just as advertised! The level of detail and thought put in to the design is unbelievable.   Location is great, quick walk to the blue line. Check in/out is super easy, and the studio manual made our interactions minimal.   Great place to stay, will absolutely repeat.   Thanks again!",1.0
Chicago,"This place was great. It's worth the price just to swim around in that huge bathtub. Ellie was a great host, and the apartment had everything you could need for a great time in Chicago. I found most places I needed to go (food, cute shops, metro) to be about a ~10 min walk away, which I don't mind because I love to walk, but if you don't consider getting a car. It was really easy to get to downtown using the train. I have no complaints, this was an awesome  place!",1.0
Chicago,"This is such a cute, clean and comfortable space! I could stay here for weeks! Nice little neighborhood. Had initially worried about noise at night, but it did quiet down for a restful evening.  The fresh ground coffee, sodas, beer help to make it comfortable. Nice distance from downtown. Safe to run in the mornings with a park nearby. Love this place!",1.0
Chicago,"Ellie’s studio is absolutely stunning! She goes above & beyond for her guest! There are loads of local nicknacks laying around the studio to indulge into. She has her cabinets stocked with things one might need (ibuprofen, cotton swabs, razors, etc). The neighbor hood is very nice. There are not many of taxi’s in the area, so if you don’t drive one might want to download uber. Definitely worth the stay! Would definitely come back!",1.0
Chicago,"Fantastic stay! The studio was as pristine as pictured. You felt more like you were staying in a hotel than someone's home. Great amenities like shampoo, soft towels and even yoga mats! Would highly recommend,",1.0
Chicago,"Elinor's studio was a magical place, and I could tell as I soon as I stepped up to the door, because care was taken in styling the exterior with little faerie lights that sparkled. I hate to say this, but I can be a bit of snob when it comes aesthetic and decor. I have not one complaint about this studio. I was absolutely blown away. The incredible level of detail and design, even down to the studio's handbook was meticulous and thought out.  What's even more wonderful is the central location to all the haunts in the Bucktown/Wicker Park area. I drove and literally everywhere I went was less than a 10 minutes away. I can't imagine that taking public transportation would take any longer. If you do drive, Elinor provides a parking permit, which gives you the freedom to park anywhere in the vivinity without the fear of getting a ticket.  By far Elinor's place is one of the best spots I've stayed in for Air BnB. If you're looking for something magical and romantic (oh, I forgot to mention there's wonderfully restored claw-foot Victorian bath tub) look no further.",1.0
Chicago,Stayed here while visiting Chicago. The apartment was really clean and cozy and located in a really good location for our trip. We were able to park right out front for our stay and walk everywhere. If you're looking to spend time in the Ukrainian Village i would recommend staying here. Close to the train if ya want to travel other places too.,1.0
Chicago,"The initial observation of the space was of course a stylish space for a reasonable price.  Seeing the space in person is such an enjoyable experience - especially when noticing all the fine details not revealed in the online pics.  It is in those details that raises the level of impression and sets it apart from other spaces.    Elinor and I had minimal contact, but that was because instructions were clear on the check-in and check-out procedures, where to park, and even how to make the coffee - which we were thoroughly confused at first.    I enjoy exploring different places to stay when visiting areas, but I would consider staying here again on my next trip to Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"I enjoyed my stay at Elinor's studio apartment in Wicker Park.  The location was pefect for me.  The studio was quite stylish and had many personal touches, including a studio manual which I found quite helpful and fun.  I really appreciated the 2 bottles of wine and the beer selection in the fridge.  The kitchen was minimal but that was fine with me because I planned to enjoy Chicago's dining scene.  The bed was  very confortable, which was a definite plus.  The heater was somewhat louder than I was expecting, but that is the only concern I had.  I would definitely stay here again.",1.0
Chicago,"This is a great spot. Located near hip Wicker Park and related. Quiet, good access to Metro and very pleasant spot to hang out and do some work too. Hostess was very helpful on restaurants etc . This is a top BnB!!!",1.0
Chicago,"The space is exactly as described. Gorgeous. The bathroom is stylish, clean, and the shower is great. Would love to have a space like that in my own home tbh. They have cute touches throughout the studio, including Where Chefs Eat (I have that at home too!) and Studs Terkel's ""Working"" in the bathroom. The bed was really comfortable and once we figured out how to configure the NEST properly for our purposes, the temperature control was on point. One minor note is that both heat and cool air come out predominantly at the head of the bed, and it could be bothersome to people who are sensitive to dry air. My wife had to turn to the foot of the bed one night because she's super sensitive, but it didn't bother me much. The location was good for me because I don't need to be right downtown and don't mind taking a Lyft everywhere, plus I like to be in ""real"" neighborhoods. Puerto Rican restaurants abound as well as cool street art, if you care to venture around. It's about a twenty minute drive to many downtown area attractions. The hosts were very accommodating to my needs, as I had to cancel one day due to a family emergency. They were very easy to work with throughout. Will definitely look to return here my next stay in Chicago",1.0
Chicago,Elinor's place is close to perfect. Every corner of the space is thoughtfully detailed and styled. It's located very centrally to Logan Square and the Bucktown/Wicker Park area and I enjoyed walking the neighborhood in my downtime. Her communication was clear and extremely quick and I truly cannot say enough about how pleasant my stay was. Highly recommended.,1.0
Chicago,"Before I arrived, I loved the photos and thought the place would be perfect for my stay over New Year's. Walking in, it was somehow even better. From the furniture to the lighting to the tableware, everything in the space is very intentionally curated. I have a feeling the owners are designers; the whole place has a great aesthetic while still being comfortable. One of my favorite places I've stayed so far",1.0
Chicago,"We had a great stay at this charming, stylish studio. Clean digs and thoughtful touches like coffee, beer, and wine were lovely. Location was perfect for getting around town by foot or Lyft, yet the street itself was quiet and residential. Great host communication and simple check in and check out. Would stay again in a heartbeat!",1.0
Chicago,"I love this spot . The layout, decor and vibe are definitely hip. Everything is so easy + the communication with Elinor is on point. The amenities are great . The experience is very hommie , every time you discover little details that make a difference in your stay.   If you’re looking for something local, not loud ,  away from tourists this is definitely a good location.",1.0
Chicago,"Ellie’s place is so so wonderful! Chic, stylish, beautiful location from which you can easily access the trendiest Chicago area, Wicker Park. Ellie responds in mere minutes should you need anything and the keypad entry makes it so easy to come and go as you please, no need for keys! 10/10 would recommend and hope to stay here again! ❤️",1.0
Chicago,"Beautiful decor with so much space! Instructions for checkin were easy to follow. The coffee and extras were great!  Very comfortable bed! The apartment has an urban ambiance. Jeremy provided parking passes and we were able to find parking a block away. Communication was excellent. Jeremy answered any questions I had almost immediately. Neighborhood had a safe feel. We walked to local restaurants close by. One unfortunate thing, which was no fault of our host- when we went to leave, we discoveredthat our catalytic converter was stolen off of our car. I had driven our older SUV since I knew it would be parked for several days. Turns out, these are easiervehicles to get under and cut. I would not hesitate to stay here again.",1.0
Chicago,"This Airbnb is the best! Location and space are the key highlights! Jeremy has great design taste! Close to the train and many restaurants. We would definitely stay here again! If you’re visiting, try the rolled ice cream across the street! We had it twice!",1.0
Chicago,"The apartment was absolutely fantastic and everything was as good as advertised. The entire unit was much more spacious than it appeared in the photos which was a welcomed surprise as I have stayed in several Airbnb's that were smaller than photographed.   You could not ask for a better location, one block from the blue line which made traveling to/from O'Hare and into downtown a breeze. You're also within walking distance to countless top notch restaurants and shops.  Jeremy was a very responsive and accommodating host and he really made us feel taken care of when we had some flight plan changes. I would recommend this apartment to anyone wanting to visit Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"There is much to like about this apartment.  It's spacious, has full amenities, plenty of character, parking is included, and the place is clean.  Wicker Park is growing, has a unique vibe, feels safe, and offers options within walking distance for groceries.  The area also has many choices for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and drinks.  We chose to use the kitchen for breakfast, and the waffle maker was a great perk.  A critical factor in comfort, rest and relaxation is the bed.  While clean, we found the mattress to be uncomfortable.  It currently presents itself as firm and lumpy with indentations and sag from years of use.  Upgrading this one very important item would make this location, apartment, and experience worth renting again.  We enjoyed our stay overall and will keep this as an option in the future.",1.0
Chicago,"Came to Chicago for my cousin's birthday party. It was in my old neighborhood, so I felt very much at home. The place was spacious and exactly how it was described! I briefly meet Jeremy when I arrived, he was extremely nice. Would love to come back here when I visit Chicago again.",1.0
Chicago,"I loved this loft and everything about it.  The location was great - 1.5 blocks from the CTA - we were able to explore the entire city using public transportation.  Check in and check out were a breeze.  Jeremy was kind and offered great suggestions when we met briefly during the stay.  The apartment was spotlessly clean, comfortable, quiet and well appointed.  This was my first visit to Chicago and I would gladly stay here on my next trip.",1.0
Chicago,"We loved this place. It's spacious and very convenient. If you have small children, you may want to know that there is a firehouse nearby, but it did not bother us, we expected city noises. There's a Metro station barely a block away. It's great to have a washer and dryer right in the apartment since we tend to pack very lightly. We greatly appreciated the neighborhood parking stickers Jeremey provided and we easily found parking about 1 block away on a safe, residential street. We'll stay here again next time we're in town.",1.0
Chicago,"This is a large, 1 bedroom apartment within 2 blocks of the blue line. Very convenient! There’s a well equipped full kitchen with a small grocery across the street. Of course there a numerous great restaurants in the area so there’s no need to cook. The apartment was very comfortable and clean. We had plenty of pillows, blankets, towels etc. which was much appreciated.",1.0
Chicago,"This was my very first AirBnB and if all of them are like this one, I'll never stay in a hotel again. Jeremey's communication was excellent from start to finish and his home is so beautiful and immaculate. It is easy to find and right off the blue line. The home had EVERYTHING I needed and then some. He even left me 2 day parking passes for the area which made people coming by easy to park nearby. It is in a very cool neighborhood and as a single woman staying in an area I've never been, I felt very safe. When I visit again, I would definitely stay there again.",1.0
Chicago,Jeremey is a wonderful host and his place is extremely nice. He is quick to respond with any questions and is willing to give recommendations around the city. The place was clean and decorated with care. It has everything you would need during your stay.,1.0
Chicago,"Jeremy's apartment is exactly as advertised - stylish, large, comfortable and spotlessly clean in a very safe, hip neighborhood.  The kitchen has all you would need to fix your own meals.  We, however, opted to take advantage of the multitude of excellent bars, coffee shops and restaurants within very easy walking distance on Division Street and North Milwaukee Avenue (for lovers of high quality Nepalese / Indian food we recommend Cumin on North Milwaukee). Communication with Jeremy was very easy.  If and when we return to this part of Chicago Wicker we would, without hesitation choose to stay in Jeremy's place.",1.0
Chicago,"We were very pleased with the apartment. With an updated modern kitchen and bathroom we had everything we needed to be comfortable. Jeremy was a great host, communicated all details we needed when needed.",1.0
Chicago,Jeremy's place was fantastic! It is really big. Was great to unpack and have space and feel at home. Really close to the blue line. Easy to get anywhere. Felt safe in the neighborhood. Fire station next door but never bothered us or woke us up. Would definitely stay again!,1.0
Chicago,Our stay was great! Jeremey was very responsive when we asked him about accommodating our two dogs during the stay. There was even a small crate provided that we ended up using for the smaller pup. Everything was just as described and the apartment is close to many great restaurants and shops. We'd stay again! :),1.0
Chicago,"Jeremey's place is fantastic -- it's bigger than we were expecting and has a really nice overall feel to it.  It's nicely decorated and has all the amenities you would need.  Jeremey was very quick to respond to messages and helped out if anything at all was needed.  Check-in was simple and the building felt secure.  It's just a couple minutes' walk to the blue line, which brings you right into downtown in about 10 minutes.  Also close to some cool spots on N Milwaukee, like Oiistar, the amazing ramen place.  Super nice experience and we'd definitely stay with Jeremey again!",1.0
Chicago,"This was perfect for our needs.  Everything was as advertised.  It's a beautiful space and the location is great.  (Ashland itself is not too appealing but you're a one-minute walk from blue line, can stroll west on Division or walk up Milwaukee Ave to Bucktown.).  Self-checkin was super easy and we had everything we needed.",1.0
Chicago,"Jeremy was very responsive, answering all questions quickly and thoroughly.  His place was nice and very clean.  My parents stayed at the Air BnB to visit me and were quite pleased.  Being that I own and live in downtown Chicago, I can say that this location fantastic and the price to be a great value.",1.0
Chicago,This place is one of the nicest accommodations I have ever stayed at. Yes the price is expensive compared to a hotel but if you want a solid night's sleep and little slice of home be sure to check out Jeremy's place!,1.0
Chicago,Wonderful place.  We really enjoyed ourselves and relaxed at Jeremey's loft.  Very clean.  We enjoyed being able to watch people on the streets from the loft.  Love the mixture of cultures which we don't get much of back home.  Location was great.  Very quick walk to get to Wicker Park and many great local restaurants as well.  Felt very safe in the neighborhood and at Jeremey's place.  Super nice people.  Jeremey is fantastic at returning messages.  Always a quick reply and we had no problems at all that couldn't be fixed quickly.  Highly recommend Jeremey's loft!,1.0
Chicago,"Jeremey's apartment far exceeded our expectations.  The pictures don't do justice to how beautiful, stylish and very spacious this place is, not to mention comfortable and clean.  Everything was simply perfect.  Every possible amenity to make you feel right at home--we wanted for nothing.  Comfortable bed and couches, beautiful, roomy bathroom with large shower and plenty of hot water, fully stocked kitchen, excellent wi-fi and incredibly easy check-in process. We loved the location, merely 2 short blocks (roughly 3 min) walk to the Blue line on the L/ subway.  So easy to get to the main attractions downtown, but also in a great spot to explore the Wicker Park/ West Town neighborhoods and all the great restaurants and shops.  An excellent Airbnb experience--Thank you, Jeremey!!",1.0
Chicago,We found it exactly as advertised—perhaps even better. Super accommodations in a great location. Jeremey was very accessible and promptly responded to our requests and questions. We look forward to staying there again on our next trip to Chicago.,1.0
Chicago,We LOVED the location. The area seemed very safe and was central to the blue line and a Divvy bike station. (Tip: take the blue line to and from O’hare to save a lot of money on transportation) The apartment was very roomy and we enjoyed having access to a kitchen. Something to note is the TV does not have cable or “smart” access. We ended up buying a firestick so we had something to watch while winding down at the end of our days. Jeremy was quick to respond any time we had questions or needed anything! Thank you for a great stay!,1.0
Chicago,"Better than it looked online, a beautiful space with everything needed and then some. Great location, close to public transportation and wonderful local spots. Jeremy was attentive and helpful with all of my queries. Would stay here whenever I’m in Chicago. Can’t recom enough!",1.0
Chicago,"This is a beautiful unit in a great neighborhood in Chicago.  Jeremy was a great host and was easy to communicate with.  Check-in and check-out were a breeze and the apartment was spotless.  It's on a busy street but there was very little noise.  The blue line is a block away as are Target, CVS and a bunch of great coffee shops and places to eat.  Also super easy to pick up a cab or an Uber/Lyft.  Would recommend this place without hesitation!",1.0
Chicago,Communication was fast and easy and Jeremey was available every step of the way.    Apartment was better than I expected.  Great location and very close to the Blue Line which can get you just about anywhere.     Would absolutely recommend and would stay here again in the future.   ,1.0
Chicago,"This is a spacious apartment and very nicely furnished. The location is just a few minutes walk from the blue line with quick transportation direct to the heart of downtown. Check-in was easy and the host provided a sheet with lots of helpful suggestions for local eating places, of which there are many.  Staying at Jeremey's place for 4 nights provided a very comfortable place to stay for our tired bodies after spending our days exploring Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,Jeremey’s place is very spacious and clean.  It has everything you need for a short or long term stay.  Jeremey is very nice and answers any question very promptly.  The location is also very convenient for travel on public transport.  Highly recommended!,1.0
Chicago,"Couldn't have asked for a better place. It was super easy to get to and from both town and O'Hare, with a Blue Line stop only one block away. It was beautiful and cheerful as well. Loved the full kitchen and nice extra-large tub. Jeremey was a lovely host. I wish we could have stayed even longer!",1.0
Chicago,"Great location with convenient transportation. The neighborhood has a cool vibe. As a vinyl record collector, I was excited about being across the street from Dusty Groove and close to Reckless Records. Great overall experience.",1.0
Chicago,"My wife and I spent 2 nights at Jeremey's place. While pictures can often be deceiving, we were pleasantly surprised at how large and open the apartment was in person. It was perfect. Jeremey was traveling in Spain at the time, but he was quick to respond to questions we had the day of and during the trip about things such as checking in and adjusting the nest thermostat. We'd happily stay there again.",1.0
Chicago,Great space in a convenient location—a vibrant neighborhood and just a block from blue line. The apartment has a good vibe and personality and is very clean. Jeremy was attentive and responsive. I’ll go back.,1.0
Chicago,"Jeremey's apartment is really great. It's large and bright in all the right places (and quieter and darker in the bedroom, which is lovely for sleeping), stylishly decorated (without being overdone--the decor fits the urban space perfectly), has a fantastic shower, everything you need for a comfortable stay and is in one of my favorite Chicago neighborhoods, with a bajiggety restaurants, bars, shops, etc. The provided parking passes are super helpful, especially for weekend stays, because parking in this part of the city is no joke (in fact, if you can manage without a car, do, because you won't need it once you're here--everything is walkable, lyft/uber is plentiful and the El train is literally right there.)  If mobility is an issue for you, you should know that you have to walk up a flight of steep, narrow stairs to get to the apartment. Also, it's really in the real city, and real cities generally aren't that quiet, so if you're a super sensitive sleeper who needs deep, dark silence, you'll maybe want to bring ear plugs and/or a sleep mask.   But otherwise, I completely recommend this place. Jeremey is a kind, helpful and responsive host, the apartment is so lovely, and it's a really great value for Chicago, too.",1.0
Chicago,"We enjoyed our stay at Jeremy’s place. It's conveniently located, about 15 minutes to the loop and 20 minutes to Midway airport. Although we got around with Uber, the blue line is just minutes across the street. The apartment is super clean and lovely decorated. Jeremy is very thoughtful with the travel guide and tips. It was great to meet a Cal alumni at Chicago. =) I would recommend this listing to everyone.",1.0
Chicago,"This home was great. Jeremey provided easy check in details and instructions. The location was great because I was close to everything downtown and many shops and stores. I recommend this home and would certainly stay here again. Thanks again, Jeremey!",1.0
Chicago,"Jeremy was easily accessible for any questions via text and he even checked in the second day to make sure everything was okay. The apartment spacious, comfortable and centrally located. Just a few steps to the blue line CTA train, restaurants and shops. The neighborhood is busy so the provided parking permits were a huge plus.",1.0
Chicago,"This space is amazing. Plenty of room, furnishings are great, kitchen has everything you could need, and the shower was perfect after a long day of exploring Chicago in the cold. Jeremey was prompt with responses and great about giving me tips on places to check out. Literally just a few steps away from the Blue Line which made getting around the city super easy. I will definitely be looking to get this place again next time I am in Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"Great place! We stayed there with our 18month during our summer holiday trip, all three of us loved Jeremey’s place. Bigger than expected. Jeremey was very supportive and fast with all kind of questions. We can highly recommend this place, also when you are traveling with small children.",1.0
Chicago,"What a great stay in Chicago!!! Jeremey‘s loft is perfectly situated in one of our favourite areas within Chicago. There are so many things to explore in walking distance: restaurants, shopping, parks, and the great 606 trail. The train („L“, blue line) - which is more or less directly in front of the apartment - connects you directly with downtown as well as with the airport. The apartment is so cool, we would love to live there! Despite the busy street in front of the house the apartments inside is so quiet and we slept like babies. Jeremey is a fantastic host and helped us a lot to find our ways, gave us great recommendations and answered immediately whenever we wrote a message. We will definitely come again!!!",1.0
Chicago,"A very spacious and spotlessly clean apartment, it holds special charm with bare brick walls and wooden floors with plenty of seating and a very large bed with a well equipped dressing room.  The bathroom is great with a very impressive bath for easing away the muscles after a long day of exploring.  We didn’t use the kitchen much apart from making a hot drink as we ate out most of the time but there is a great health food shop just opposite and a food shop just by the subway station.  Although we didn’t get to meet Jeremey his communication with us was superb.",1.0
Chicago,"Jeremy’s place is amazing, not only is it huge, it has everything you need for a comfortable stay, it’s in a great location for getting around town (literally one minute walk from the blue line at Division), and really easy to get to on the blue line from O’hare airport.  Jeremy was a fantastic host, very quick to respond to any queries we had, and was kind enough to let us leave our bags for a couple of hours while we went for brunch before heading back to the airport.  I would highly recommend his apartment to anyone wanting to explore Chicago.",1.0

Chicago,"Rob’s place was beautiful! It looked exactly as advertised. The apartment was spacious & stylishly decorated. Lots of restaurants & bars within walking distance, as well as a grocery store. Rob was super responsive & hospitable. We were not able to check in before 3, but he allowed us to leave our luggage in his store prior to check in & even took it upstairs to the apartment for us! The only downside was that the bedroom can get a little warm, especially on a hot summer day. Other than that, we fully enjoyed our stay. Would definitely stay here again!",1.0
Chicago,"Rob’s Place was beautifully furnished and decorated. It was also only a 3 minute walk from the nearest bus stop which can take you to downtown or any of the metro/L lines - very convenient. The only downside is that there is no air conditioning in the bedroom so it got really hot. It is also on the 3rd floor so that’s something to consider if you don’t like taking the stairs. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and would recommend it!",1.0
Chicago,Rob's place is immaculate! I have never seen an Airbnb so tastefully decorated and cozy. Its in the middle of a bustling restaurant and shopping district but is surprisingly quiet. Rob himself was very responsive and a great host. I would definitely come back here for sure. Make sure you take advantage of the $20/day parking that Rob offers. It was a lifesaver.,1.0
Chicago,"My experience could not have been better. This was the mog immaculate, stylish, modern, and comfortable AirBnB experience I've ever had. The owner has spared no expense, from stainless steel alliances to remodeled bathrooms and showers, to new wood flooring. The temper-pedic bed was heavenly, and the furnishings were modern and comfortable. The attention to detail was unparalleled, from train maps and restaurant guides to Chicago artwork and plenty of cooking utensils and supplies, as well as beauty and hygiene products. I was beyond impressed with the level of care and consideration.   When I return to Chicago in the future, this will be my first choice. Always.",1.0
Chicago,We were In Chicago to see Hamilton and sightsee with our teenaged daughter. We loved this location and neighborhood. It felt safe and there were tons of nearby places to eat or get groceries. The condo itself was extremely clean and was well stocked with necessities. It was spacious and we never felt crowded. Rob was a great host and was very responsive to our questions. It was a plus to have  parking available as we never moved our car until we left Chicago. I would definitely rent from Rob again,1.0
Chicago,"Rob's place is incredibly stylish, supremely located, and overall provides a comfortable, beautiful perch from which to explore the city of Chicago.

Chicago,"This place is a fantastic stay!  Everything is wonderfully decorated, well thought-out, very clean, and it has an authenticity you can only find in a beautiful historic building.  The location is great as well. It’s a 13 minute drive to downtown Chicago, and 500 feet from the best breakfast place in town “Whisk”. You must go there!  Only thing missing in the Airbnb was coffee, so you may want to bring your own. But they have multiple ways to make it if you do.  Great stay, highly recommend this Airbnb!",1.0
Chicago,My wife and I came in to Chicago for our wedding anniversary and are so glad we chose to stay with Rob.  Probably the best Airbnb experience we’ve had.  He really thinks of everything and we can’t recommend staying here enough.,1.0
Chicago,Rob’ s space is 5 stars & beyond. He has gone the extra steps to make his guests well informed about the neighborhood & totally took care of everything you need to be comfortable away from your home. This Airbnb is the cleanest place we have ever stayed in.!!! You feel like you are his VERY FIRST guests! The photos give you a glimpse of the home but it out shines even those. Very modern & well appointed decor. His Christmas decorations were beautiful. He is warm & personable & communcation is outstanding. You will not be disappointed in your stay at Rob’s home!!!!,1.0
Chicago,"By far-this Rob's place is the most STUNNING home my husband and I stayed in. The décor is stylish, modern and pure class. The Holiday decorations made it festive and cozy. I really want those flocked trees!! LOL Absolutely gorgeous. The pictures of this listing does it NO JUSTICE!! Rob is a delight and one of thee most gracious hosts I have encountered. His level of hospitality is unparalleled and he gave us some great suggestions of local eateries in the area. His home is in great proximity to downtown and other neighborhoods. We truly could not be more pleased and dreaded leaving to return back to our home state. However, we will certainly be back and definitely in the process of making plans to book Rob's home again. You will not be disappointed!! Truly his home is a GEM!!!",1.0
Chicago,"The warmest home we've ever been in. Sparkling clean, modern and superb interior design, great location and a very lovely, warm host. Thank you, Rob and we promise to only stay at your place whenever we're in Chicago! An experience to remember!",1.0
Chicago,"This was the cleanest Airbnb we’ve ever stayed in. If you are picky with finding a clean place that actually FEELS clean, this home is for you. You can immediately tell that Rob takes pride in his apartment and everything is so well maintained and stylishly decorated. The bed was a welcomed place for rest after a long day, and we loved how firm the mattress was and how fluffy the pillows were—very comfortable.  The amenities were spot on, the coffeemaker, the gas stove, plenty of dishes and quality cookware to use for making a meal. Not mention, the exceptional decor of the entire apartment! The location was excellent and walkable to numerous local restaurants and bars (a few were literally steps from the apartment door). We loved being on the third floor and always felt super safe. There is some traffic noise that can be heard in the bedroom, but Rob provides earplugs for light sleepers. In truth, we actually enjoyed being lulled to sleep by the sounds of the city and it didn’t bother us at all. The convenience of the grocery store being a 5 minute walk away made buying some pantry and fridge essentials easy. The couch in the living room was super comfy and perfect for relaxing and watching the Thanksgiving Day parade and some Netflix Christmas movies. This was the perfect Airbnb and we were highly impressed (not always easy). 5 stars to Rob for such an amazingly clean, comfortable, stylish, and well thought out home away from home. We’ll be back soon!",1.0
Chicago,"This place is so much nicer in person! And wow the bed was so comfortable we ended up sleeping the first night we got there instead of going out because we got trapped in the bed lol. Communicating with Rob was very easy and his home was supplied with everything!! First aid kit, make up remover wipes you name it lol. The home is in a very quiet and safe neighborhood. Would definitely stay again, one of the nicest places I have ever stayed!",1.0
Chicago,"We had a short but wonderful stay at Rob's place for a weekend trip to Chicago. Communication and check-in were quick and easy, and it was a breeze to get there from the airport on the train and a bus.  The space was spotlessly clean and beautifully furnished, with thoughtful touches that made our stay really comfortable. The location is great too, with a grocery store nearby and lots of good food/drink options as well.  Our only regrets are that we didn't stay here longer to enjoy it more and that we had to catch a Sunday morning flight before we could peruse the beautiful store downstairs some more. We would definitely stay here again, and will happily recommend it to any family and friends who may be looking for a place to stay in Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"Rob’s apartment was exactly what we need for a wonderful stay in Chicago. It was styled beautifully and Rob provided everything we could possibly need- thought of everything!

Chicago,"This might be my favorite Airbnb stay to date. The apartment so stunning, clean, and comfortable and charming Ukrainian Village with so much to offer, we chose to make fewer trips into the heart of the city to spend more time enjoying and exploring the immediate surroundings both in and out of the apartment. Yoga, restaurants, shops, grocery...everything within walking distance and this little oasis to temporarily call home. Rob couldn’t have been a better host. Will be back for sure!",1.0
Chicago,Rob’s place was amazing. Right in the center of everything. The location was close to many restaurants and bars. It is also a short ride to surrounding neighborhoods and downtown. The place itself was amazing with all the amenities needed for a great stay. Rob was prompt in his communication and was right below if needed. The parking space was a bonus as it is hard to find parking in this neighborhood without a permit.,1.0
Chicago,"Location, atmosphere, beautiful decor, every thought to amenities (even a First Aid Kit!)... you simply can't go wrong with this great condo in Ukrainian Village.  It was a snowy weekend so we especially enjoyed the cabinet full of games!  We were visiting family in Streeterville and getting there was no problem at all.  Rob greeted us when I arrived, and check-out was very simple.  Also, my brother drove over from a neighboring city to meet me, so we appreciated the off-street parking for him and his daughter.  Stay with Rob!  You won't regret it.",1.0
Chicago,"This is a stylish, modern yet comfortable apartment located in a cool part of town with lots of options to dine and a young at heart hip vibe.

Chicago,"This was our first AirBNB and I gave 5 stars all the way through. Chris was an amazing host. Quick responses and clear communication. Super helpful with us as we learned to navigate city, food and parking. Being from a rural area, we were grateful to have the help! Maps on fridge. Nice residential area, felt safe even at night. Extremely clean. Special touches such as video games and snacks. Went above and beyond to provide a welcoming and safe environment. Room was stylized, modern. Plenty of amenities, even access to laundry. If we make our way back to town, we’ll stay here again. Thank you for making our first AirBNB memorable!",1.0
Chicago,"Great place to stay! Very clean and convenient to food and shops! Reminded me of being Ina little apartment. The shower was a bit small, so if you're a larger person it may be difficult to fit. But it was a very nice place and the host were quick to respond.",1.0

The decor is fantastic and we loved many of the little touches including the board games, tasteful art, game systems, and the water and drinks in the fridge were a welcome surprise after our evening arrival. Having central heat as well as a space heater in the unit helped make sure we stayed nice and toasty during our visit. We didn't take advantage of them, but the fact that a washer and dryer were available was a nice bonus.   We'll definitely look here first on our next trip to Chicago!",1.0

Chicago,"What a gem! Christopher’s place was exactly as described including a ton of extras. Christopher was quick to respond before and during my stay. He left a light on for me the night I arrived since I had a super late flight. He even checked in on me the next day to make sure I had everything I needed. The place was totally spotless. The bed was very comfy and there were tons of extra pillows. The kitchen was fully equipped and he even stocked it with several quick food items. These were much appreciated especially the first morning. The space felt so much more roomy than I was expecting. Ceilings are a bit lower being a garden unit but I had no problem at all with it. The water pressure in the shower was really great. Christopher made a really detailed welcome guide with lots of great info abt the neighborhood. The studio is only 3 short blocks away from a bus that takes you directly to the belmont el station (abt a 20-30 min ride). I felt very safe in the neighborhood (family vibe) even when coming in using transit late at night by myself. If you are wanting to do a lot of things in the Loop, transit took me 45-hour sometimes depending on the time of day. This was not a big deal for me bc I wanted a neighborhood experience vs more of a downtown touristy one, but it did take longer to get to and from. Lastly, Christopher was kind enough to  hold my luggage for me on my last day since I had a later flight. All in all, fantastic experience and I highly recommend this listing. Thank you so much, Christopher!",1.0
Chicago,Christopher’s place was was everything I could have hoped for. It was a nice cozy place where my girlfriend and I felt immediately at home.

Chicago,This is such a great place to stay! Awesome location between the airport and downtown. Uber’s were always there within 5 minutes and were reasonably priced for a ride to anywhere in the city.

Transportation was nearby and made our rides to the city very convinient, also we got to explore more of it by using transportation.

Chicago,Chris was an amazing host.  His place was very clean and better than we expected.  This was the wife’s first time visiting Chicago and she wasn’t disappointed as this place offers a lot of space for two guests.  Parking on the same street was hit and miss but that can be expected for a big city.  We took Lyft anytime we were visiting downtown Chicago.  It was nice to come and go as we pleased.  Chris responded very quickly to any messages that were sent.  I felt safe enough walking in the general neighborhood.  When we visit Chicago again this would definitely be the first choice.  Our first host cancelled which brought us to finding this gem.,1.0

Chicago,"This place was amazing and super comfortable. On top of being such a stylish spot, Logan Square itself is a neat area filled with coffee shops and yummy foods. We got awesome suggestions on places to eat and drink and it doesn't take too long to get into the city. 10/10 would recommend!!",1.0
Chicago,"Samantha & Jonathan's loft was exactly as pictured, and located in a convenient location. I loved the apartment - I would love to live here myself! The stairs to the loft was quite steep as others describe, and I left my suitcase downstairs and only went upstairs to sleep. The bed was very comfortable. My friend whom I stayed with wanted an easy access to the bathroom during night, so she decided to use the air mattress downstairs, which we found in the closet (we moved furnitures around to make space). The walk to the California CTA station was 15-20 min for me, but since it was quite a cold week, I often opted for Uber. As we had packed plans in downtown, we did not get to explore much of the neighborhood nor get to ask for neighborhood tips that Samantha was happy to share, but I'd love to come back to this loft and explore more!",1.0
Chicago,"The loft is located in a great quiet spot that is walking distance from great restaurants and bars. It was a ~15 minute walk from both the Logan Square and California blue line stops, and extremely close to tons and tons of good restaurants and bars (check out Lula, Giant, and Longman & Eagle). Samantha was a great host and the place was spotless when we arrived, with tea and some nice snacks sitting on the table. Checking in and out was as easy and quick as it gets, and we appreciated Samantha periodically messaging us to check on our experience. We would stay here again in a heartbeat. Our only warning is that all the stairs in the building are extremely steep and narrow. We didn't have any problems, but you should be careful. Overall a 5/5 experience.",1.0
Chicago,"The space is exactly as pictured.  Simple, basic, perfect for one or two people.  The bed in the loft was comfortable and the HDTV had plenty of premium channels.  The neighborhood is quiet and we felt safe.  Parking on the street wasn't an issue for us, but it did seem to be full in the evening.  Major bus line is 3 blocks away that will take you straight to the northside Fullerton train stops and the Blue Line station that goes to the loop is about 8 blocks away.  The host is easily reached and communication was great.  Thanks!",1.0
Chicago,"I enjoyed my stay in this space! The studio itself was very clean and quiet during sleeping hours. The staircase to the bed was a little steeper than I had expected, but it was sturdy and I got used to it. It was in a lovely location that had access to buses and trains. I did do a bit of walking, but that was my choice. Samantha and Jonathan were quick with communication and gave suggestions for the area. I would stay again. Thanks!",1.0
Chicago,"Great location (walking distance from Logan Square), safe and quiet neighborhood, and a beautiful, clean, well-stocked space. Also, the design of the apartment is ingenious and full of delights. You have to check it out. We really loved staying here.",1.0
Chicago,"Samantha’s place is fantastic!  As a host, she was so available and communicative.  She offered great neighborhood recommendations.  The place is super clean, hip, and we loved the loft!  I’d recommend this spot to anyone!  It’s great!",1.0
Chicago,The loft was perfect. Exactly as shown in the pictures. Check in and out were super easy. Samantha is an excellent host and she makes things really easy. Location was good and it really made our stay in Chicago an excellent experience. We would definitely come back,1.0
Chicago,"My partner and I loved our stay in this brightly lit and trendy loft! It was exactly as pictured in photos but had great extra touches – hair straightener, iron, coffee, maps etc. Check in and check out were seamless and communication was fast and friendly. We would definitely stay here again. Thank you!",1.0
Chicago,"Samantha's place is absolutely marvelous! It's located in a nice residential area, with some fun bars and restaurants in the neighborhood. If you don't want to wait for a bus, it's a bit of a walk to the blue line, but nothing bad. Uber rides into the city were not that expensive and an easy way to get into the city. The apartment itself is really, really nice. Clean, spacious and an extremely comfy bed. I would highly recommend it to anybody!",1.0
Chicago,A very stylish flat with lots of complimentary toiletries and helpful guide books for the area. The flat isn’t in the city centre but taking an Uber carpool is a cheap and easy way of getting into the main part.,1.0
Chicago,This is a beautifully-designed loft apartment in an upmarket part of town.  It is sparkling clean and has some nice touches such as local coffee. Communication with Samantha was very smooth and she answered our questions quickly.  I would highly recommend staying here in Chicago.,1.0
Chicago,"Lovely apartment in a great area of the city.  Local amenities were perfect (I'd recommend Tony's for any grocery requirement and Wyler Road for a chilled drink and a bit to eat!) and not too far from the ""L"" to the Loop where it's a 20 min ride in.   Hosts were great and very responsive to any request and requirement we had and helped out as much as possible.  The stairs up to the mezzanine are definitely steep but we expected this from the description so not a problem at all and the apartment is carefully thought out to give maximum usability of the space.  Overall a fantastic expperience of this amazing city.",1.0
Chicago,"Place was amazing! My boyfriend and I absolutely loved our stay here in this loft. Area is very clean and very stylish. All of our questions were answered very fast and accurately. Everything was supplied for us, they even had Q-tips lol. ",1.0
Chicago,"We had an amazing stay at Samantha's place. It is located in a quiet neighborhood within 20min walking distance from the blue line. The apartment is spacious and has everything you need including cooking facilities, big comfortable bed, tv etc. We were a bit delayed and arrived late in the evening, but Samantha was extremely kind by helping us ordering pizza while we were absolutely wrecked from traveling. Furthermore, she always responded very quickly to questions from us. We ran in to her husband Jonathan a couple of times who was also super friendly and gave us a ton of advice on what to do in the city. Overall we had a great couple of days in Chicago and we definitely recommend this place! ",1.0
Chicago,"Samantha's place was perfect for our weekend getaway. Travel around the city was very convenient with transit and biking options very closeby. The space was extremely tidy and comfortable, and our hosts were very accommodating...thanks for a wonderful Chicago experience!",1.0
Chicago,"This apartment is great! The apartment itself is already beautiful and special with its high ceilings, and the location is also very nice. In walking distance from Logan square, with nice coffee bars, restaurants, shops and street art. But also in walking distance from public transport that takes you to downtown in just a few stops. We would definitely recommend this place for a great visit to this great city",1.0
Chicago,"Lovely loft studio, spotlessly clean and very well designed with everything we needed. Location is good with the metro about 15 mins walk away then 20 mins to downtown, and a Chicago bike scheme station 5mins away and an even quicker cycle to downtown. We also enjoyed the 606 trail, Chicago's answer to the Highline which is also close by.  So a great place and a great location.",1.0
Chicago,Beautiful apartment in quite neighborhood. The space is great it's location relative to public transit is awesome. Samantha was quick to respond to any questions. I will definitely be checking availability next time I'm back in Chicago.,1.0
Chicago,"We had a great stay at Logan Square. The appartment was spacious (more so than we expected) and very clean with thoughtful provisions provided.   Samantha and Jonathon provided us with a great list of nearby places do eat and drink (from fresh coffee to pizza) and were very helpful in communicating when we asked for help.   Logan Sqaure itself is a lovely leafy neighbourhood around half an hr from Downtown on the train. There's plenty of amenities a short walk from the appartment, as well as loads of great bars. A taxi into Downtown is quicker but more expensive.   The 'L' (elevated train) is a 15-20 min walk from the appt and then a further 15 min or so ride into downtown where there is plenty to do. A weekly ticket for the train is around $30 and gives you access to trains and buses. Very handy for getting around as the bus and L system is easy to use.  On a clear day, we would recommend hiring a bike and taking the Lake Shore route which runs alongside Lake Michigan. You get stunning views of the iconic skyscrapers from across the water.  Hancock Tower on a clear day is also a must see too, with great views for miles.  If the weather is cooler, then there are loads of great museums to visit. the History of Chicago by Lincoln Park is great. The Old Town is nearby for a drink afterwards too.  Definitely a great city to visit with lots to do, and a great appartment in a great neighbourhood. 10/10  Thanks",1.0
Chicago,"The apartment was lovely, clean, and the coffee/snacks were appreciated. The security within the apartment was great, and although the surrounding area was less confidence-inspiring, she had us send a photo of our car once we arrived, and the area had cameras, so it put me at ease. We were super close to both bus and train options that we utilized several times, and within walking distance of target for quick pick-ups. We enjoyed our stay!",1.0
Chicago,"Kay is the best superhost you will ever have!! She is great with communication and is very welcoming! Her apartment has a home-like feeling that will make your vacation even better. Cleanest place ever!! Absolutely spotless and smells amazing!!  If you are looking for suggestions of where to eat and shop, Kay will give you a list of her favorite places and provides a variety brochures, pamphlets, flyers, and food menu’s! I had mentioned my family was vegan and she gave me options of food choices around the area!  Great location!!! I highly recommend staying at Kay’s place if you are visiting Chicago!!",1.0
Chicago,"Kay’s place was very cute and clean!! She was super quick to respond to anything. The train is a quick walk from the apartment though I don’t think I would personally feel safe walking from the train tooo late at night as a young lady. Loved how she  had treats available like bananas, it’s, orange juice, coffee. It is very convenient for a quick trip to downtown Chicago!",1.0
Chicago,"Even though Kay's place was more on the south side of Chicago and I was going to the north side for a Cubs game, her place was great for a one-night stay with how reasonably priced it was right before Memorial Day weekend. I just got ubers to get to and from the game rather than public transit. Kay's place was very comfortable and she was a great host!",1.0
Chicago,"Kay’s place was amazing! Such thoughtful, kind touches, and Kay is super communicative. Seriously, this room was nicer and more well-equipped than some of the luxury hotel’s I’ve stayed at. 100% would stay here again!",1.0
Chicago,"From the extreme cleanliness of the apartment to the added extras everywhere you turn, this place was absolutely perfect! The host is respectful and generous with the most friendly senior kitty ever! Coming “home” to a snuggly feline in the living room was probably the best thing ever (I’m an extreme cat person). However, if you’re not into cats, no worries; the cat isn’t pushy and you could probably spend your entire trip ~not~ seeing him if that’s more your style. The off-street parking was clean and safe, something that can be hard to secure in Chicago. The apartment is located very close to both the train and the bus, making in-city traveling quite easy. I would highly recommend this AirBnB!",1.0
Chicago,It’s a wonderful and comfortable place to stay. Kay is really great at communicating with guests and is super nice and welcoming. The space is very clean and has a nice charm to it. We only stayed for one night but I definitely will keep this place in mind if I ever make it up to Chicago again.,1.0
Chicago,I extremely enjoyed my stay at Kay's place.  The location is perfect. My favorite part was having a Target with a Starbucks and market near by. This place is also closely located to a CTA and the freeway entrance if you have a car.  Kay provides many good ameneties and I was very happy for that. She is quickly responsive and super helpful. I'm glad I got to meet her. She is a sweet person.  It is 15 min away from the city.    Also if you have a rental/car there is parking near by!!!  Thanks Kay,1.0
Chicago,"Five stars isn’t enough! Kay made me feel very welcome and comfortable. I felt as if I was staying with family or an old friend, definitely not a stranger. She provided breakfast and coffee for me before I headed out and it definitely gave me a great start. I have a cat at my place, so their friendly lil guy made me feel even more at home. I would definitely recommend her to anyone else and will definitely stay with her again if the opportunity arises.",1.0
Chicago,"I was pleasantly surprised by how amazing the experience turned out to be at Kay's home. The entire house felt inviting and immediately puts you at ease. She puts the guest first and it shows in her thoughtful approach to outfitting the room. From soft bath towels and a loofah at your bedside, to the coffee and tea bar in the kitchen for hot drinks in the morning. She really wants you to feel like you are taken care of the moment you walk in the door. The location is convenient with good selection of restaurants in the area to choose from and downtown is a hop and a skip away for those who want to take in the sights. If it isn't obvious already,  I highly recommend staying with Kay during your trip to Chicago!",1.0
Chicago,"I stayed at Kay's place with two of my friends over St. Pat's weekend. The free parking was a huge blessing, and the apartment was very close to the CTA for local travel. The apartment itself was clean and well-kept. Kay was a wonderful host! From giving us travel recommendations to providing some St. Patrick's day accessories, she made our stay as enjoyable as possible. We also enjoyed helping ourselves to the coffee bar and playing with her adorable cat. All of our expectations for our stay were far exceeded and I would gladly stay here again.",1.0

Chicago,"Kay was a perfect host. She went out of her way to make sure I was comfortable and ensured I had everything I needed. Her place is so cute and even offers a breakfast bar with coffee, snacks and breakfast foods. She even left a loofa, towels and washcloths for me with chocolates. Also, there were loads of local brochures and magazines to browse. Her 16 year old cat Toby is such a love! He was super friendly and sweet. It was raining on the day I was going out to adventure in the city and I Kay was so cool about lending me her umbrella. She’s a kind soul and was so helpful with local tips for eats and getting around. Highly recommend staying at Kay’s!",1.0
Chicago,"Kay provided a great Airbnb! She was prompt in her responses and provided a few extra touches that made our stay very welcoming (water bottles in the room's mini-fridge, clear and prompt communication, breakfast items (although we skipped out on those), well-labeled instructions outside the door on how to get in as well as within the house to make things very clear, etc.)",1.0
Chicago,"Best Airbnb I've stayed in! Clean, safe, great communication, fantastic amenities, nice and modern/cozy/stylish vibe, easy check in and out, great location: basically this Airbnb had it all and then some! Kay was also super nice and accommodating. I would definitely stay here again and recommend to others!",1.0
Chicago,"Kay's place was perfect for me- free parking in a lot, close to the metro, and south (the direction I was coming from).  Kay is friendly, and her place is clean.  I'll definitely see if Kay's place is available the next time I  visit Chicago!",1.0
Chicago,Kay is an Amazing host with an air bnb that makes you feel at home! The entire house is sparkling clean and full of creative and cute decor. This room is spacious and fully furnished with all the amenities you may need. The check-in/out is simple with thorough instructions. The el (CTA train) is a short 5min walk in a safe neighborhood. This is the second time I’ve stayed here and both times there were other guests yet it was very quiet and comfortable stay and rest. Respect this space as it truly is a gem!,1.0
Chicago,Great stay. Kay’s place was in a great location close to downtown and public transportation. The room and bathroom were very clean and had nice touches. Didn’t meet Kay until the last night (my schedule) but she was very nice and personable. If definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone!! Thank you Kay,1.0

Chicago,"Kay's place was really awesome in a good neighborhood, easily accessible from public transport. Very highly recommended, especially for budget travelers like myself.   The apartment and room were cozy and I felt like being at home during my stay, with access to kitchen and living room area. The cat is super friendly too!   Kay as a person was a nice host. She even gave me some medicine upon request, as I was catching some cold from the weather in Chicago.   If I ever come back to Chicago I have a reliable place to stay :)",1.0
Chicago,"Kay is an absolute pro of a host.  She communicated check-in instructions very clearly and regularly  touched-base to make sure I had everything I needed during my stay.  Her place is ideally situated a mere 5 minute walk from an L train station (which is a fantastic way to get around Chicago as I discovered).  Very comfortable, clean, and safe place to spend your nights when visiting Chicago-- can't recommend enough.",1.0
Chicago,"The misfortune of staying at Kay's is that one will quickly realize that not every host will be like her! :-/ I was able to take the train (as she pre-stay suggested) directly out of midway and walk about 2 blocks & if cleanliness is next to godliness, then trust Kay has you covered. And to be completely honest, Kay extended herself to me in an act that goes way beyond the scope of AirBnb. I was comfortable, I felt safe, the room was very dedicated. Being that she was my 1st AirBnb experience,  I really feel like I lucked up. Omg, and her snack bar (fresh yummies), were too delish! :-* #BookHer",1.0
Chicago,"Kay is a fantastic host and I can not recommend her enough. When we contacted her for anything we needed, the response was lightning-fast! She was courteous and made her home warm and inviting for her guests. She really took a burden off our shoulders while planning a last-minute trip to Chicago. If you’re looking for a great experience for a really reasonable price, definitely book with Kay!",1.0
Chicago,"If I could give 6 stars I would. Kay's place was immaculate, cute, comfortable, easy to access — everything you could ask for in an Airbnb. Kay herself is an excellent and hospitable host, helping us out with umbrellas, breakfast, sunscreen, loofas — all the little things that shows she truly cares about making her guests' experience as amazing as possible. She is a gracious and generous person and I would 100% stay at her property again. ",1.0
Chicago,"If you don't like stairs or cats, that is the only reason not to stay here. Location is good, ample parking & light outdoors- ammenities are top & Kay is an awesome host with a BIG heart for her aging cat- that alone should make her 1st choice for any cat lover.",1.0
Chicago,Kay's place was absolutely amazing. She was a perfect host and made my vacation feel so comfortable. I was traveling alone and one late night she even messaged me to make sure I was ok.

We ended up uber-ing to and from the house when we had our suitcases, but aside from that it was a pleasant 20-min walk to the L train. Overall it's a great deal, and their dog Meatball is fabulous (and he knows it :) )",1.0
Chicago,"The place is comfortable, clean, with your own bathroom. Check in and welcome instructions are very detailed and thoughtful. I particularly appreciated a drawing map of the neighborhood, it was very helpful, like having a local to guide you.

It was overall a great and comfortable stay.",1.0
Chicago,"Nice private room, with a firm/squeaky bed. (Just like the description!) beautiful house, in a nice neighbourhood. Gin and Michael offered us coffee and homemade muffins in the morning!

Quick and easy access to downtown, via or the pubs/restaurants of the area via train, or bus. Nice map of the neighbourhood in the room. There is so much to see and do in Chicago, stay a while! We have to come back and explore some more, and we would definitely stay at Gin’s again! :) Thanks again!",1.0

Not to mention, it’s like a 2 block walk to all of these spots!   We recommend Paulie Gee’s square pizza. It’s a beautiful creation. Navigator Taproom has plenty of options and a full bar. It’s real fun to pour your own drinks! Breakfast at Cozy Corner is a must!  Moral of the story, stay here. You can thank me later!",1.0

We felt right at home. My colleagues and I kept looking around saying, ""I love this place. I don't want to leave"". On more than one night, we decided to stay in (rather than go out) just so we could enjoy the fire, movie, selection, and some homemade pasta! I will definiltey be recommending this to anyone and everyone who plans to visit Chicago. BONUS: Just down the street from the best diner/vegan food in the world.",1.0

As it was February in Chicago, we loved the fireplace to keep the space nice and warm. The flat was very clean, and stocked with towels and products for the shower. Danielle gave us a mega list of recommendations ahead of time, which was super helpful and full of cool restaurants and bars. The apartment is in Logan Square, and while we spent a good deal of time there and in places like Wicker Park, the freezing weather had us in lots of Uber’s downtown as well — just something to keep in mind. Though, it’s also off a subway line. Overall, no complaints, and Danielle’s communication was amazing. Would definitely recommend.",1.0
Chicago,I love love love Danielle's place.  It's extremely charming and well decorated. You can definitely tell she put a lot of effort into all the details of the apartment.

Chicago,"This has got to be in the top two best airbnb experiences I've had. Danielle's place is so cozy and looks amazing. We ended up spending a lazy Sunday lounging inside by the fireplace and watching dumb movies - an ideal way to spend a day after heavy touristing Friday and Saturday. She was incredibly accommodating throughout our stay with complications our party had with check in and check out. The surrounding area had an incredible pizza place, a bar where we got boozy ice cream floats, some breweries, and way more that we didn't have time to discover because we didn't want to leave the fire. Will 100% look to stay here again in the future!",1.0

Chicago,This was a truly desperate search for a safe place for my daughter to stay last minute while out of town.  She made last minute plans to travel to Chicago for the Gold Cup soccer match.  Once there she could not find a hotel to rent to her because she is 18.  She was in her car crying.  I booked with Jim on the internet and spoke with him by phone.  He was so great!!!  He met her and her boyfriend at the door.  He even spoke Spanish with her boyfriend which made him feel great.  He assured me by phone about how safe the neighborhood  was and that he would be on the premises just a moments notice away.  He treated them like adults but still helped me feel comfortable about their safety knowing they will always be my babies.  It was truly above and beyond.  And my daughter said the apartment was gorgeous.,1.0

Nice quiet neighborhood with Uber/lyft convenience to most city locations in 15-20 min. Apartment is on ground floor, some street noise but overall very quiet. Neighborhood is safe with quick walks to great eating spots. We recommend the little red wolf & mhenry.  Apartment is well furnished with nice appliances & conveniences, great WiFi. Host was attentive, but only needed on day 1: we’re pretty low key. Only recommendation would be additional blankets/ linens for pull out couch in living area.",1.0

Chicago,"Our stay in Chicago was great and we really enjoyed staying in Andersonville. It was far enough away to be quiet but only a 12-15 minute walk to the train station, which we didn’t mind at all. The neighborhood felt safe enough to walk in and we liked the local coffee shops and restaurants.   The apartment was nicely decorated and clean. I would just give a heads up that if you’re a light sleeper you can hear the hosts upstairs because it’s an old building. I would never take away a star for this because it’s just a personal thing. My wife is a heavy sleeper and it never bothered her but I had to download a white noise app on my phone to fall asleep.   The hosts were great communicators and asked if we needed anything and how our stay was going. We both enjoyed it and would stay here again!",1.0

Very clean, well appointed, extra towels and pillows, fantastic magazines for relaxing reading, GREAT map of the local neighborhood in order to find fantastic local shops and places to eat.  You can totally get around on public transit (mostly CTA Bus) from this apartment. Note: the place is a little far from the CTA train stations into downtown. We rented a car and really appreciated the flexibility to get around the city easily and great neighborhood street parking.   The apartment is well appointed with everything you need for your stay. One of the bedrooms is street facing but there is not much traffic so it stayed very quiet at night. Air conditioning for the summer time is a huge plus on muggy hot days!  Andersonville neighborhood is one of my favorite areas of Chicago. It is quaint, full of local  charm, great eats and drinks within walking distance, and a fantastic way to get a feel of what real Chicago is like (and not the fake touristy stuff). Off the beaten path geek thing we did - we drove to and walked through the nearby Rosehill Cemetery Mausoleum. The old original section has a substantial collection of LC Tiffany stained glass windows and walking the completely silent hallways to see the sun shining through these beautiful windows is pretty awesome if you like that sort of thing.  Love Jim's place! Beyond 5 stars! We will hopefully be back to town and rent out his apartment again in the future. ",1.0
Chicago,"Great space to spend a few days. Neighborhood was a few miles north of the downtown area of Chicago. Very quiet but still had the Chicago city feel to it. Quick Uber rides to the downtown area. 5 stars all the way around, would definitely recommend and would definitely stay there again.",1.0
Chicago,"Jim and Maximo were incredibly informative and hospitable. Whenever we needed anything, there was a quick response. Lots of quality amenities, extremely clean, but doors and footsteps from floors above can be a bit loud at times. Otherwise, it was an amazing stay!",1.0

So you guys are very nice  and  your hospitality goes beyond  what words can describe .  I know  past experiences  that Airbnb have change my life on how I stay in a city or a place of my travels keep up the good work.  So your place very  amazing  it’s worth every penny that I spend.

Chicago,Great apartment and location!!! Andersonville is a charming little neighborhood of Chicago. We easily took Uber/Lyft to and from the city and airport. I would highly recommend staying here. Thanks again!,1.0
Chicago,"The apartment was beautiful with 2 comfortable beds, with the bedrooms on opposite ends of the unit from each other.  A very short walk (few short blocks) from downtown Andersonville with all of it's shops and restaurants, with a farmers market every Wednesday. Beautiful area to walk around. I'd recommend it to anyone looking to stay in the area.",1.0
Chicago,"Jim and Maximo were great hosts! This spacious two-bed, one-bath is the perfect getaway for family and friends! I picked Andersonville, because it's a great LGBTQ+ friendly neighborhood and was a great location to experience all of the Pride festivities happening over the weekend during our stay. Jim and Maximo were super responsive and very accommodating throughout my entire experience even before arriving for the weekend! The neighborhood is a family-friendly area and was very walk-able with lots of places to go for food, coffee or to go grocery shopping. The apartment was very spacious, clean and had lots of cute touches/decorations to make the place feel like home. I will definitely look to stay here again in the future during my next visit to Chicago!",1.0

Perfect for business stays or a nice getaway. You won't regret staying here.",1.0
Chicago,"This place was phenomenal. It was just as pictured, the location is awesome to the city we visited, both hosts handled any/all things we needed/checked up on us, and all of our necessities were met and beyond. This was a very pleasurable stay and I would definitely recommend this place to friends if they ever come visit Chicago.   You have everything you need within a short walk and if you really need to, there’s a Target .7 miles from the place. Close eating and bar spots within a short walk. It takes about 20-30 min to get into Chicago.   Awesome visit and great hosts.",1.0
Chicago,"Jim & Maximo we’re outstanding hosts. Every detail of this beautiful apartment was lovely. The location was great for our stay in north Chicago. And while our schedule did not allow for it, we appreciated the tips on where to go in the neighborhood. Communication was excellent, and the extra comforts made us feel very welcome and comfortable. And the decorations are so charming!",1.0
Chicago,This is our favorite place to stay in Chicago!   The location is excellent!  The apartment is beautiful!  Jim and Maximo are excellent hosts and think of added details to make you feel right at home.   We look forward to our next stay.,1.0
Chicago,"Amazing location, very walkable to all things that you need - restaurants, grocery stores, pharmacy, coffee shops, etc. worked great for 2 of us and the space is really clean and neat. We didn’t have a car and found it super easy to Uber most places outside the neighborhood. Thanks for a great stay!!",1.0
Chicago,"Loved Jim and Maximo’s place, it was very spacious, clean and stylish. I enjoyed looking through the magazines and the beds were extremely comfortable. The neighborhood is terrific, close enough to public transportation, cofffee shops, restaurants and not too far from the lake. Street parking was so easy, parked in front every time no matter what time of day. Thanks for an excellent experience for my family and me!",1.0
Chicago,"Jim’s place was (Website hidden by Airbnb) pictured and described...super cute, spacious, and comfy! Great neighborhood with access to awesome restaurants within walking distance, and easy ~12-15 min walk to red line to get into downtown. Our family also appreciated the local playgrounds and family vibe of the neighborhood. Jim and Maximo were wonderful hosts. They were quick to communicate with us and responsive to our needs. We would definitely stay again upon a return visit to Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"We really enjoyed staying at Jim's place over a quick weekend get-away to Chicago. It's very close to all the Andersonville shops and restaurants on Clark St. and a short walk to the el stop to go downtown; it's in a lovely, quiet, leafy neighborhood of brownstones. Parking was easy -- there was street parking right outside the apartment; we parked the car when we arrived Friday and didn't need to move it or use it until we left on Sunday. The apartment was very clean and well-appointed, with a great kitchen and nice amenities. Jim was there to give us the keys when we checked in; he and Maximo were available if needed but also gave us space. We'd highly recommend this one!",1.0
Chicago,"Stylish apartment in a great location with convenient parking and great restaurants/shops nearby. We really enjoyed our stay here. The kitchen had everything we needed to cook and prepare our own food. Jim was very responsive and accommodating, which made everything easy and enjoyable. I wish that we could have controlled the heat ourselves, but when the apartment started to get a bit chilly, we notified Jim, and he was able to turn on the heat for us quickly. Overall a great space and great experience!",1.0
Chicago,"Jim’s place is aesthetically pleasing, clean, and comfortable. It is in the lovely neighborhood of Andersonville and accessible to many restaurants and shops. I appreciated the clear communication, quick responses, ease of check in, and helpfulness when I needed to extend my stay. The house is well equipped with the conveniences and thoughtful touches that are helpful to a busy business traveler- a high quality iron and real ironing board, a washer and drier, toiletries, coffee etc.I would definitely stay at Jim’s place again.",1.0
Chicago,"We loved staying here! The place was beautiful, with many nice touches, a charming older building but remodelled with modern amenities, and sparkling clean. Getting in was very convenient, there were snacks left there for us to enjoy, parking on the street was easy, and Jim and Maximo always responded immediately to all of our queries, plus checked in to see if we wanted coffee, or needed anything else from them, checked on the comfort of the beds, and generally made sure that we had a great stay and felt well cared for. The kitchen is well appointed - the only thing not available was a microwave, but Maximo commented that he's about to get one for the apartment so that can be expected soon.  This is a great apartment with caring and involved hosts. I recommend staying here unconditionally!",1.0
Chicago,"The apartment was beautiful and very spacious. There are restaurants, grocery stores and pharmacies within walking distance. The neighborhood seemed very safe and we enjoyed walking around even in the cold weather. The Keurig and snack basket were nice touches which we appreciated. The beds were  too firm to be comfortable for me, but my boyfriend was fine with it, so it may be personal preference. Jim and Maximo were very attentive and always ready to help. Please note, the apartment does not have a microwave. Also, there is a policy that you cannot have any guest enter into the apartment (not just for sleeping, but for visiting too) which I misunderstood when booking, but it was not a problem since it was only the two of us. If you're traveling in a group or with family staying in other places, you may want to look for another place if you want them to be able to visit you. Overall our stay was lovely and we would recommend this apartment.",1.0
Chicago,"Location, location, location! The spot is located in a beautiful historic neighbourhood filled with lots of charm, great shops, and fantastic restaurants within walking distance. The space was incredibly clean, beautifully decorated, and had everything we needed for a great weekend. Jim was a great host and provided all the amenities we could have needed. 10/10 would stay here again!",1.0
Chicago,"This is a clean and beautifull apartment. Really clean and tidy, felt like home.  Close to coffee shops and general shops.  Jim and Maximo  checked up on me to make sure all my needs were meet and told me where the good coffee shops are. I highly recommend staying. I will deff come back in the future. 10/10 :)",1.0
Chicago,"This was my second stay at Ellie’s place, and I maintain that it’s one of the best Airbnbs ever! So quiet, clean, stylish, and comfortable. The tub is awesome and the coffee’s great, what more could I ask for?",1.0
Chicago,"Place was great! Clean, cozy, great location. Check in & out went seamlessly. LOVED the bathtub and shower. I would definitely recommend. The TV package was a surprising plus.. not usually one to hang out too much at a bnb- but after a day of drinking at Wrigley we were feeling a little rough-  it was so nice to just chill out the next day watching movies and ordering food! Loved it!",1.0
Chicago,"As a single traveler the studio set up was perfect for me. The location was great, since I had just been staying downtown at a conference prior to my stay it was nice to get out a bit and see some other neighborhoods. I could easily walk to the 606 Trail - which I really enjoyed - and N Milwaukee Ave for some fun shopping. I appreciated the guide they had in the studio with local recommendations listed, I got take-out from the Indian place down the street and it was delicious. Very comfortable bed!",1.0
Chicago,"Elinor went above and beyond to accommodate our stay, the level of hospitality was excellent!   The space is gorgeous and welcoming. I love that every detail was thought out, and this carries out throughout all the pieces in the home. Definitely a gem in the city.",1.0

Chicago,"I absolutely loved this place! I already told my sister that when we get the chance to go to Chicago together we will absolutely have to stay there. It was the perfect size and had everything I needed. The style of the whole place was gorgeous. I can tell a lot of thought went into creating this space. The shower and bathtub were amazing, and it was very helpful that there was a hair dryer, shampoo/conditioner, body wash, etc. When I do get the chance to travel to Chicago again I hope this is available. I can’t say enough about how much I loved this place!",1.0
Chicago,"From the incredibly easy check in and location, to the thoughtful touches that made us feel at home, to the impeccably curated style, we absolutely loved stayed here. It will be our go to any time we are back in Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"What can I say except that Elinor’s place was great! The little touches, such as welcome beers, pour over coffee, books on Chicago, and available toilet trees (we flew in and only had carry-one) were perfect. We only used the room for sleeping since we spent most of our day and night exploring the city! The weather is Chicago sure is unpredictable and crazy, so make sure you have a jacket or umbrella on stand by! Haha Thank you again for allowing us to stay in your lovely place!",1.0
Chicago,"We loved this place! It has all of the amenities and comfort of a nice hotel and more. The space was stunning, just like the photos. It felt very private which was great. We appreciated all of the books about Chicago and local restaurants. We’ll be back!",1.0
Chicago,This place is exactly as it looks! Super cute with personal touches so you know you’re getting an authentic experience. It’s close enough to the L to make traveling to and from the city accessible! Would for sure stay here again; wish I had more time :),1.0
Chicago,"OMG this place is so fantastic. It's PERFECT. I'm going to stay here again for sure! Great location, excellent host, so stylish and cool. The place also comes with an amazing little booklet to tell you how to use the WiFi and coffeemaker, and how to get around.",1.0
Chicago,"If I had more a sense of self-interest, I would write the  worst review ever so that this amazing space is always available for me when I'm in Chicago. First: it is it's own little building in the city. Wow! It's designed so beautifully, I took tons of photos to inspire my guest house back in CT. Elinor was responsive, accommodating, and super nice. I'm spreading the word to all of my friends who are jazzed staying there. The location is 10-12 minutes from downtown... well worth it for these gorgeous accommodations. BTW: the photos don't really capture the details and inviting sweetness of the place. I'll see you again, Elinor!",1.0
Chicago,"Ellie and Devin's space is charming! It's a well-designed, well-maintained large studio with incredibly thoughtful touches: books about the history of Chicago, more books from Chicago based writers and poets, games, postcards, and even stamps. I was a little nervous the first night with the studio being so close to the street, but I slept like a dream – the bed is comfortable and the studio is airy and bright. The place is exactly as pictured, even better. Ellie and Devin were very responsive and helpful. I would definitely come back and highly recommend staying here.",1.0
Chicago,This place is in the best part of the city! So easy to walk everywhere! It is clean with amazing amenities! The cute little touches! The great bath and shower! The delicious pour-over coffee! I want to stay there again.,1.0
Chicago,Elinor’s apartment is the perfect place for a cozy and stylish stay in Chicago. Everything we could’ve needed was provided and Elinor’s neighborhood recommendations were superb! I would highly recommend this place to anyone wanting to visit Chicago (and to avoid tourist traps)!,1.0
Chicago,"I can’t say it enough- this is THE best Airbnb I’ve ever stayed at and is so cozy! It’s worth every penny! I came to take my boards and it was just perfect for the stay. It’s so stylish, quaint, adorable neighborhood, and the little touches are unlimited! There was wine and beer stocked in the fridge, a cute pour over coffee pot and trader joe beans with a grinder! Basically I’m sad I can’t just move and stay in forever. People always say, “oh I’ll be back” but this is serious, I can’t wait to book again! I have best friends who live in the city and I’d still pay to stay in this awesome space! Airbnb MVP! Don’t hesitate! Book it now!",1.0
Chicago,"What you see on the photos are absolutely accurate and more! Loved the open space, high ceilings and obviously the bath. I've been using Airbnb for most of my travels and this is one of the nicest and most aesthetically pleasing location I have ever stayed at!",1.0
Chicago,"My fiancé and I were in town to celebrate our anniversary weekend. We couldn't have picked a better place to stay. The open layout, soft lighting, and claw foot tub all made it seem like a dream. Thank you so much!",1.0
Chicago,"Ellie was fantastic, super fast responses to my emails. Her place was fantastic, and right in the neighborhood where we needed to be. Hate to say this, but she could easily get more per night given the location and how awesome the space is.   Cheers!",1.0
Chicago,"Great place! Great host! We actually had major delays on our flight out of Chicago and she offered for us to stay another night. We felt loved and cared for. If you want a spot not in the downtown hustle but still in the city enough to Uber for good rates, look no further. Quiet neighborhood. Pictures described the space very accurately. It was the perfect space for a quick getaway to Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"Amazing and beautiful first airbnb experience. The place was decorated very modern and was clean. Both the walk in shower and claw-foot tub were great and the water got very hot. The bed was super comfy! There were plenty of towels, extra sheets, and blankets to use as well. There were also nice personal touches such as food recommendations and stocked beverages in the fridge (water filter, coffee, and some wine). Me and my boyfriend had an amazing time.",1.0
Chicago,"Wonderful place to stay while visiting the windy city of Chicago! Not far from great restaurant, bars, shopping and downtown. The coach house is decorated to perfection in mid-century modern decor and very clean. My husband and I used Uber all weekend and waiting no longer than 2 min. for a pickup at the house.  Highly recommend a stay at this location.",1.0
Chicago,"Great place to stay in Chicago. The space is very functionable and artsy, open and airy- we loved it. Comfy bed, all amenities you would want and then far more are provided. There are even beautiful post cards for you to write home with! Highly recommend it!",1.0
Chicago,Ellie’s place is exactly what you see in the all - no false advertising. It’s very light and open and she maximizes the space greatly. She’s very easy to communicate with. The Damen & Western L stations are close enough walk which we utilized a lot. Would definitely stay here again!,1.0
Chicago,"Gorgeous! I loved staying here. It was in a cool neighborhood and the studio was clean, styled well, and the bathroom was top notch. I want to stay here every time I come back to Chicago. They also have postcards and stamps for your use. Sweet little detail. Thanks so much!",1.0
Chicago,"This is a fantastic place. Super bright, extremely clean, great design, and extremely comfortable. Parking was easy. Check in and check out were super convenient and Elinor was very responsive. Can’t recommend highly enough!",1.0
Chicago,Eleanor's place was fantastic! Every detail was thought of including the courtesy postcards depicting her cat who sits in the window in the house on Artesian Street on the front. I would come back to Chicago just to hang out in this cool Studio for a weekend.,1.0
Chicago,"This is a gem of a space that is a close walk to some great cafes, shopping, and night life. As someone who travels a fair amount, I would say this was one of my favorite stays at an AirBNB. The space itself is very thoughtfully curated. ",1.0
Chicago,"There is a reason so many reviews start with how stylish the place is. That reason is because it is stunning and just as advertised! The level of detail and thought put in to the design is unbelievable.   Location is great, quick walk to the blue line. Check in/out is super easy, and the studio manual made our interactions minimal.   Great place to stay, will absolutely repeat.   Thanks again!",1.0
Chicago,"This place was great. It's worth the price just to swim around in that huge bathtub. Ellie was a great host, and the apartment had everything you could need for a great time in Chicago. I found most places I needed to go (food, cute shops, metro) to be about a ~10 min walk away, which I don't mind because I love to walk, but if you don't consider getting a car. It was really easy to get to downtown using the train. I have no complaints, this was an awesome  place!",1.0
Chicago,"This is such a cute, clean and comfortable space! I could stay here for weeks! Nice little neighborhood. Had initially worried about noise at night, but it did quiet down for a restful evening.  The fresh ground coffee, sodas, beer help to make it comfortable. Nice distance from downtown. Safe to run in the mornings with a park nearby. Love this place!",1.0
Chicago,"Ellie’s studio is absolutely stunning! She goes above & beyond for her guest! There are loads of local nicknacks laying around the studio to indulge into. She has her cabinets stocked with things one might need (ibuprofen, cotton swabs, razors, etc). The neighbor hood is very nice. There are not many of taxi’s in the area, so if you don’t drive one might want to download uber. Definitely worth the stay! Would definitely come back!",1.0
Chicago,"Fantastic stay! The studio was as pristine as pictured. You felt more like you were staying in a hotel than someone's home. Great amenities like shampoo, soft towels and even yoga mats! Would highly recommend,",1.0
Chicago,"Elinor's studio was a magical place, and I could tell as I soon as I stepped up to the door, because care was taken in styling the exterior with little faerie lights that sparkled. I hate to say this, but I can be a bit of snob when it comes aesthetic and decor. I have not one complaint about this studio. I was absolutely blown away. The incredible level of detail and design, even down to the studio's handbook was meticulous and thought out.  What's even more wonderful is the central location to all the haunts in the Bucktown/Wicker Park area. I drove and literally everywhere I went was less than a 10 minutes away. I can't imagine that taking public transportation would take any longer. If you do drive, Elinor provides a parking permit, which gives you the freedom to park anywhere in the vivinity without the fear of getting a ticket.  By far Elinor's place is one of the best spots I've stayed in for Air BnB. If you're looking for something magical and romantic (oh, I forgot to mention there's wonderfully restored claw-foot Victorian bath tub) look no further.",1.0
Chicago,Stayed here while visiting Chicago. The apartment was really clean and cozy and located in a really good location for our trip. We were able to park right out front for our stay and walk everywhere. If you're looking to spend time in the Ukrainian Village i would recommend staying here. Close to the train if ya want to travel other places too.,1.0
Chicago,"The initial observation of the space was of course a stylish space for a reasonable price.  Seeing the space in person is such an enjoyable experience - especially when noticing all the fine details not revealed in the online pics.  It is in those details that raises the level of impression and sets it apart from other spaces.    Elinor and I had minimal contact, but that was because instructions were clear on the check-in and check-out procedures, where to park, and even how to make the coffee - which we were thoroughly confused at first.    I enjoy exploring different places to stay when visiting areas, but I would consider staying here again on my next trip to Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"I enjoyed my stay at Elinor's studio apartment in Wicker Park.  The location was pefect for me.  The studio was quite stylish and had many personal touches, including a studio manual which I found quite helpful and fun.  I really appreciated the 2 bottles of wine and the beer selection in the fridge.  The kitchen was minimal but that was fine with me because I planned to enjoy Chicago's dining scene.  The bed was  very confortable, which was a definite plus.  The heater was somewhat louder than I was expecting, but that is the only concern I had.  I would definitely stay here again.",1.0
Chicago,"This is a great spot. Located near hip Wicker Park and related. Quiet, good access to Metro and very pleasant spot to hang out and do some work too. Hostess was very helpful on restaurants etc . This is a top BnB!!!",1.0
Chicago,"The space is exactly as described. Gorgeous. The bathroom is stylish, clean, and the shower is great. Would love to have a space like that in my own home tbh. They have cute touches throughout the studio, including Where Chefs Eat (I have that at home too!) and Studs Terkel's ""Working"" in the bathroom. The bed was really comfortable and once we figured out how to configure the NEST properly for our purposes, the temperature control was on point. One minor note is that both heat and cool air come out predominantly at the head of the bed, and it could be bothersome to people who are sensitive to dry air. My wife had to turn to the foot of the bed one night because she's super sensitive, but it didn't bother me much. The location was good for me because I don't need to be right downtown and don't mind taking a Lyft everywhere, plus I like to be in ""real"" neighborhoods. Puerto Rican restaurants abound as well as cool street art, if you care to venture around. It's about a twenty minute drive to many downtown area attractions. The hosts were very accommodating to my needs, as I had to cancel one day due to a family emergency. They were very easy to work with throughout. Will definitely look to return here my next stay in Chicago",1.0
Chicago,Elinor's place is close to perfect. Every corner of the space is thoughtfully detailed and styled. It's located very centrally to Logan Square and the Bucktown/Wicker Park area and I enjoyed walking the neighborhood in my downtime. Her communication was clear and extremely quick and I truly cannot say enough about how pleasant my stay was. Highly recommended.,1.0
Chicago,"Before I arrived, I loved the photos and thought the place would be perfect for my stay over New Year's. Walking in, it was somehow even better. From the furniture to the lighting to the tableware, everything in the space is very intentionally curated. I have a feeling the owners are designers; the whole place has a great aesthetic while still being comfortable. One of my favorite places I've stayed so far",1.0
Chicago,"We had a great stay at this charming, stylish studio. Clean digs and thoughtful touches like coffee, beer, and wine were lovely. Location was perfect for getting around town by foot or Lyft, yet the street itself was quiet and residential. Great host communication and simple check in and check out. Would stay again in a heartbeat!",1.0
Chicago,"I love this spot . The layout, decor and vibe are definitely hip. Everything is so easy + the communication with Elinor is on point. The amenities are great . The experience is very hommie , every time you discover little details that make a difference in your stay.   If you’re looking for something local, not loud ,  away from tourists this is definitely a good location.",1.0
Chicago,"Ellie’s place is so so wonderful! Chic, stylish, beautiful location from which you can easily access the trendiest Chicago area, Wicker Park. Ellie responds in mere minutes should you need anything and the keypad entry makes it so easy to come and go as you please, no need for keys! 10/10 would recommend and hope to stay here again! ❤️",1.0
Chicago,"Beautiful decor with so much space! Instructions for checkin were easy to follow. The coffee and extras were great!  Very comfortable bed! The apartment has an urban ambiance. Jeremy provided parking passes and we were able to find parking a block away. Communication was excellent. Jeremy answered any questions I had almost immediately. Neighborhood had a safe feel. We walked to local restaurants close by. One unfortunate thing, which was no fault of our host- when we went to leave, we discoveredthat our catalytic converter was stolen off of our car. I had driven our older SUV since I knew it would be parked for several days. Turns out, these are easiervehicles to get under and cut. I would not hesitate to stay here again.",1.0
Chicago,"This Airbnb is the best! Location and space are the key highlights! Jeremy has great design taste! Close to the train and many restaurants. We would definitely stay here again! If you’re visiting, try the rolled ice cream across the street! We had it twice!",1.0
Chicago,"The apartment was absolutely fantastic and everything was as good as advertised. The entire unit was much more spacious than it appeared in the photos which was a welcomed surprise as I have stayed in several Airbnb's that were smaller than photographed.   You could not ask for a better location, one block from the blue line which made traveling to/from O'Hare and into downtown a breeze. You're also within walking distance to countless top notch restaurants and shops.  Jeremy was a very responsive and accommodating host and he really made us feel taken care of when we had some flight plan changes. I would recommend this apartment to anyone wanting to visit Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"There is much to like about this apartment.  It's spacious, has full amenities, plenty of character, parking is included, and the place is clean.  Wicker Park is growing, has a unique vibe, feels safe, and offers options within walking distance for groceries.  The area also has many choices for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and drinks.  We chose to use the kitchen for breakfast, and the waffle maker was a great perk.  A critical factor in comfort, rest and relaxation is the bed.  While clean, we found the mattress to be uncomfortable.  It currently presents itself as firm and lumpy with indentations and sag from years of use.  Upgrading this one very important item would make this location, apartment, and experience worth renting again.  We enjoyed our stay overall and will keep this as an option in the future.",1.0
Chicago,"Came to Chicago for my cousin's birthday party. It was in my old neighborhood, so I felt very much at home. The place was spacious and exactly how it was described! I briefly meet Jeremy when I arrived, he was extremely nice. Would love to come back here when I visit Chicago again.",1.0
Chicago,"I loved this loft and everything about it.  The location was great - 1.5 blocks from the CTA - we were able to explore the entire city using public transportation.  Check in and check out were a breeze.  Jeremy was kind and offered great suggestions when we met briefly during the stay.  The apartment was spotlessly clean, comfortable, quiet and well appointed.  This was my first visit to Chicago and I would gladly stay here on my next trip.",1.0
Chicago,"We loved this place. It's spacious and very convenient. If you have small children, you may want to know that there is a firehouse nearby, but it did not bother us, we expected city noises. There's a Metro station barely a block away. It's great to have a washer and dryer right in the apartment since we tend to pack very lightly. We greatly appreciated the neighborhood parking stickers Jeremey provided and we easily found parking about 1 block away on a safe, residential street. We'll stay here again next time we're in town.",1.0
Chicago,"This is a large, 1 bedroom apartment within 2 blocks of the blue line. Very convenient! There’s a well equipped full kitchen with a small grocery across the street. Of course there a numerous great restaurants in the area so there’s no need to cook. The apartment was very comfortable and clean. We had plenty of pillows, blankets, towels etc. which was much appreciated.",1.0
Chicago,"This was my very first AirBnB and if all of them are like this one, I'll never stay in a hotel again. Jeremey's communication was excellent from start to finish and his home is so beautiful and immaculate. It is easy to find and right off the blue line. The home had EVERYTHING I needed and then some. He even left me 2 day parking passes for the area which made people coming by easy to park nearby. It is in a very cool neighborhood and as a single woman staying in an area I've never been, I felt very safe. When I visit again, I would definitely stay there again.",1.0
Chicago,Jeremey is a wonderful host and his place is extremely nice. He is quick to respond with any questions and is willing to give recommendations around the city. The place was clean and decorated with care. It has everything you would need during your stay.,1.0
Chicago,"Jeremy's apartment is exactly as advertised - stylish, large, comfortable and spotlessly clean in a very safe, hip neighborhood.  The kitchen has all you would need to fix your own meals.  We, however, opted to take advantage of the multitude of excellent bars, coffee shops and restaurants within very easy walking distance on Division Street and North Milwaukee Avenue (for lovers of high quality Nepalese / Indian food we recommend Cumin on North Milwaukee). Communication with Jeremy was very easy.  If and when we return to this part of Chicago Wicker we would, without hesitation choose to stay in Jeremy's place.",1.0
Chicago,"We were very pleased with the apartment. With an updated modern kitchen and bathroom we had everything we needed to be comfortable. Jeremy was a great host, communicated all details we needed when needed.",1.0
Chicago,Jeremy's place was fantastic! It is really big. Was great to unpack and have space and feel at home. Really close to the blue line. Easy to get anywhere. Felt safe in the neighborhood. Fire station next door but never bothered us or woke us up. Would definitely stay again!,1.0
Chicago,Our stay was great! Jeremey was very responsive when we asked him about accommodating our two dogs during the stay. There was even a small crate provided that we ended up using for the smaller pup. Everything was just as described and the apartment is close to many great restaurants and shops. We'd stay again! :),1.0
Chicago,"Jeremey's place is fantastic -- it's bigger than we were expecting and has a really nice overall feel to it.  It's nicely decorated and has all the amenities you would need.  Jeremey was very quick to respond to messages and helped out if anything at all was needed.  Check-in was simple and the building felt secure.  It's just a couple minutes' walk to the blue line, which brings you right into downtown in about 10 minutes.  Also close to some cool spots on N Milwaukee, like Oiistar, the amazing ramen place.  Super nice experience and we'd definitely stay with Jeremey again!",1.0
Chicago,"This was perfect for our needs.  Everything was as advertised.  It's a beautiful space and the location is great.  (Ashland itself is not too appealing but you're a one-minute walk from blue line, can stroll west on Division or walk up Milwaukee Ave to Bucktown.).  Self-checkin was super easy and we had everything we needed.",1.0
Chicago,"Jeremy was very responsive, answering all questions quickly and thoroughly.  His place was nice and very clean.  My parents stayed at the Air BnB to visit me and were quite pleased.  Being that I own and live in downtown Chicago, I can say that this location fantastic and the price to be a great value.",1.0
Chicago,This place is one of the nicest accommodations I have ever stayed at. Yes the price is expensive compared to a hotel but if you want a solid night's sleep and little slice of home be sure to check out Jeremy's place!,1.0
Chicago,Wonderful place.  We really enjoyed ourselves and relaxed at Jeremey's loft.  Very clean.  We enjoyed being able to watch people on the streets from the loft.  Love the mixture of cultures which we don't get much of back home.  Location was great.  Very quick walk to get to Wicker Park and many great local restaurants as well.  Felt very safe in the neighborhood and at Jeremey's place.  Super nice people.  Jeremey is fantastic at returning messages.  Always a quick reply and we had no problems at all that couldn't be fixed quickly.  Highly recommend Jeremey's loft!,1.0
Chicago,"Jeremey's apartment far exceeded our expectations.  The pictures don't do justice to how beautiful, stylish and very spacious this place is, not to mention comfortable and clean.  Everything was simply perfect.  Every possible amenity to make you feel right at home--we wanted for nothing.  Comfortable bed and couches, beautiful, roomy bathroom with large shower and plenty of hot water, fully stocked kitchen, excellent wi-fi and incredibly easy check-in process. We loved the location, merely 2 short blocks (roughly 3 min) walk to the Blue line on the L/ subway.  So easy to get to the main attractions downtown, but also in a great spot to explore the Wicker Park/ West Town neighborhoods and all the great restaurants and shops.  An excellent Airbnb experience--Thank you, Jeremey!!",1.0
Chicago,We found it exactly as advertised—perhaps even better. Super accommodations in a great location. Jeremey was very accessible and promptly responded to our requests and questions. We look forward to staying there again on our next trip to Chicago.,1.0
Chicago,We LOVED the location. The area seemed very safe and was central to the blue line and a Divvy bike station. (Tip: take the blue line to and from O’hare to save a lot of money on transportation) The apartment was very roomy and we enjoyed having access to a kitchen. Something to note is the TV does not have cable or “smart” access. We ended up buying a firestick so we had something to watch while winding down at the end of our days. Jeremy was quick to respond any time we had questions or needed anything! Thank you for a great stay!,1.0
Chicago,"Better than it looked online, a beautiful space with everything needed and then some. Great location, close to public transportation and wonderful local spots. Jeremy was attentive and helpful with all of my queries. Would stay here whenever I’m in Chicago. Can’t recom enough!",1.0
Chicago,"This is a beautiful unit in a great neighborhood in Chicago.  Jeremy was a great host and was easy to communicate with.  Check-in and check-out were a breeze and the apartment was spotless.  It's on a busy street but there was very little noise.  The blue line is a block away as are Target, CVS and a bunch of great coffee shops and places to eat.  Also super easy to pick up a cab or an Uber/Lyft.  Would recommend this place without hesitation!",1.0
Chicago,Communication was fast and easy and Jeremey was available every step of the way.    Apartment was better than I expected.  Great location and very close to the Blue Line which can get you just about anywhere.     Would absolutely recommend and would stay here again in the future.   ,1.0
Chicago,"This is a spacious apartment and very nicely furnished. The location is just a few minutes walk from the blue line with quick transportation direct to the heart of downtown. Check-in was easy and the host provided a sheet with lots of helpful suggestions for local eating places, of which there are many.  Staying at Jeremey's place for 4 nights provided a very comfortable place to stay for our tired bodies after spending our days exploring Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,Jeremey’s place is very spacious and clean.  It has everything you need for a short or long term stay.  Jeremey is very nice and answers any question very promptly.  The location is also very convenient for travel on public transport.  Highly recommended!,1.0
Chicago,"Couldn't have asked for a better place. It was super easy to get to and from both town and O'Hare, with a Blue Line stop only one block away. It was beautiful and cheerful as well. Loved the full kitchen and nice extra-large tub. Jeremey was a lovely host. I wish we could have stayed even longer!",1.0
Chicago,"Great location with convenient transportation. The neighborhood has a cool vibe. As a vinyl record collector, I was excited about being across the street from Dusty Groove and close to Reckless Records. Great overall experience.",1.0
Chicago,"My wife and I spent 2 nights at Jeremey's place. While pictures can often be deceiving, we were pleasantly surprised at how large and open the apartment was in person. It was perfect. Jeremey was traveling in Spain at the time, but he was quick to respond to questions we had the day of and during the trip about things such as checking in and adjusting the nest thermostat. We'd happily stay there again.",1.0
Chicago,Great space in a convenient location—a vibrant neighborhood and just a block from blue line. The apartment has a good vibe and personality and is very clean. Jeremy was attentive and responsive. I’ll go back.,1.0
Chicago,"Jeremey's apartment is really great. It's large and bright in all the right places (and quieter and darker in the bedroom, which is lovely for sleeping), stylishly decorated (without being overdone--the decor fits the urban space perfectly), has a fantastic shower, everything you need for a comfortable stay and is in one of my favorite Chicago neighborhoods, with a bajiggety restaurants, bars, shops, etc. The provided parking passes are super helpful, especially for weekend stays, because parking in this part of the city is no joke (in fact, if you can manage without a car, do, because you won't need it once you're here--everything is walkable, lyft/uber is plentiful and the El train is literally right there.)  If mobility is an issue for you, you should know that you have to walk up a flight of steep, narrow stairs to get to the apartment. Also, it's really in the real city, and real cities generally aren't that quiet, so if you're a super sensitive sleeper who needs deep, dark silence, you'll maybe want to bring ear plugs and/or a sleep mask.   But otherwise, I completely recommend this place. Jeremey is a kind, helpful and responsive host, the apartment is so lovely, and it's a really great value for Chicago, too.",1.0
Chicago,"We enjoyed our stay at Jeremy’s place. It's conveniently located, about 15 minutes to the loop and 20 minutes to Midway airport. Although we got around with Uber, the blue line is just minutes across the street. The apartment is super clean and lovely decorated. Jeremy is very thoughtful with the travel guide and tips. It was great to meet a Cal alumni at Chicago. =) I would recommend this listing to everyone.",1.0
Chicago,"This home was great. Jeremey provided easy check in details and instructions. The location was great because I was close to everything downtown and many shops and stores. I recommend this home and would certainly stay here again. Thanks again, Jeremey!",1.0
Chicago,"Jeremy was easily accessible for any questions via text and he even checked in the second day to make sure everything was okay. The apartment spacious, comfortable and centrally located. Just a few steps to the blue line CTA train, restaurants and shops. The neighborhood is busy so the provided parking permits were a huge plus.",1.0
Chicago,"This space is amazing. Plenty of room, furnishings are great, kitchen has everything you could need, and the shower was perfect after a long day of exploring Chicago in the cold. Jeremey was prompt with responses and great about giving me tips on places to check out. Literally just a few steps away from the Blue Line which made getting around the city super easy. I will definitely be looking to get this place again next time I am in Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"Great place! We stayed there with our 18month during our summer holiday trip, all three of us loved Jeremey’s place. Bigger than expected. Jeremey was very supportive and fast with all kind of questions. We can highly recommend this place, also when you are traveling with small children.",1.0
Chicago,"What a great stay in Chicago!!! Jeremey‘s loft is perfectly situated in one of our favourite areas within Chicago. There are so many things to explore in walking distance: restaurants, shopping, parks, and the great 606 trail. The train („L“, blue line) - which is more or less directly in front of the apartment - connects you directly with downtown as well as with the airport. The apartment is so cool, we would love to live there! Despite the busy street in front of the house the apartments inside is so quiet and we slept like babies. Jeremey is a fantastic host and helped us a lot to find our ways, gave us great recommendations and answered immediately whenever we wrote a message. We will definitely come again!!!",1.0
Chicago,"A very spacious and spotlessly clean apartment, it holds special charm with bare brick walls and wooden floors with plenty of seating and a very large bed with a well equipped dressing room.  The bathroom is great with a very impressive bath for easing away the muscles after a long day of exploring.  We didn’t use the kitchen much apart from making a hot drink as we ate out most of the time but there is a great health food shop just opposite and a food shop just by the subway station.  Although we didn’t get to meet Jeremey his communication with us was superb.",1.0
Chicago,"Jeremy’s place is amazing, not only is it huge, it has everything you need for a comfortable stay, it’s in a great location for getting around town (literally one minute walk from the blue line at Division), and really easy to get to on the blue line from O’hare airport.  Jeremy was a fantastic host, very quick to respond to any queries we had, and was kind enough to let us leave our bags for a couple of hours while we went for brunch before heading back to the airport.  I would highly recommend his apartment to anyone wanting to explore Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,We had a very nice stay at Jeremy’s Airbnb. Lots of space and a big kitchen. Jeremy responds quickly to questions and everything went very smooth. It is in a good location if you want to explore Wicker Park.,1.0

Chicago,"Jeremey’s place is so beautiful, a perfect loft you could imagine with a view to a quiet street. It has lots of light, in the morning or in the evening too. Subway is 1 minute walking distance (literally)! Fire station in the adjacent building is not bothering at all, they turned out to be the most quiet neighbors we ever had :) Many thanks to Jeremey, we would like to return!",1.0
Chicago,Beautiful apartment thats is decorated to perfection. Its conveniently located (10 min walk to wicker park and 20 min subway to downtown). Jeremy was very accommodating and his local coffee & donut tips were great!,1.0
Chicago,"Rob’s place was beautiful! It looked exactly as advertised. The apartment was spacious & stylishly decorated. Lots of restaurants & bars within walking distance, as well as a grocery store. Rob was super responsive & hospitable. We were not able to check in before 3, but he allowed us to leave our luggage in his store prior to check in & even took it upstairs to the apartment for us! The only downside was that the bedroom can get a little warm, especially on a hot summer day. Other than that, we fully enjoyed our stay. Would definitely stay here again!",1.0
Chicago,"Rob’s Place was beautifully furnished and decorated. It was also only a 3 minute walk from the nearest bus stop which can take you to downtown or any of the metro/L lines - very convenient. The only downside is that there is no air conditioning in the bedroom so it got really hot. It is also on the 3rd floor so that’s something to consider if you don’t like taking the stairs. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and would recommend it!",1.0
Chicago,Rob's place is immaculate! I have never seen an Airbnb so tastefully decorated and cozy. Its in the middle of a bustling restaurant and shopping district but is surprisingly quiet. Rob himself was very responsive and a great host. I would definitely come back here for sure. Make sure you take advantage of the $20/day parking that Rob offers. It was a lifesaver.,1.0
Chicago,"My experience could not have been better. This was the mog immaculate, stylish, modern, and comfortable AirBnB experience I've ever had. The owner has spared no expense, from stainless steel alliances to remodeled bathrooms and showers, to new wood flooring. The temper-pedic bed was heavenly, and the furnishings were modern and comfortable. The attention to detail was unparalleled, from train maps and restaurant guides to Chicago artwork and plenty of cooking utensils and supplies, as well as beauty and hygiene products. I was beyond impressed with the level of care and consideration.   When I return to Chicago in the future, this will be my first choice. Always.",1.0
Chicago,We were In Chicago to see Hamilton and sightsee with our teenaged daughter. We loved this location and neighborhood. It felt safe and there were tons of nearby places to eat or get groceries. The condo itself was extremely clean and was well stocked with necessities. It was spacious and we never felt crowded. Rob was a great host and was very responsive to our questions. It was a plus to have  parking available as we never moved our car until we left Chicago. I would definitely rent from Rob again,1.0
Chicago,"Rob's place is incredibly stylish, supremely located, and overall provides a comfortable, beautiful perch from which to explore the city of Chicago.  As a host, Rob was incredibly hospitable and communicative, and was very helpful in getting me situated for the stay.  I highly recommend the apartment and would definitely stay here again!",1.0
Chicago,"This place is a fantastic stay!  Everything is wonderfully decorated, well thought-out, very clean, and it has an authenticity you can only find in a beautiful historic building.  The location is great as well. It’s a 13 minute drive to downtown Chicago, and 500 feet from the best breakfast place in town “Whisk”. You must go there!  Only thing missing in the Airbnb was coffee, so you may want to bring your own. But they have multiple ways to make it if you do.  Great stay, highly recommend this Airbnb!",1.0
Chicago,My wife and I came in to Chicago for our wedding anniversary and are so glad we chose to stay with Rob.  Probably the best Airbnb experience we’ve had.  He really thinks of everything and we can’t recommend staying here enough.,1.0

Chicago,"By far-this Rob's place is the most STUNNING home my husband and I stayed in. The décor is stylish, modern and pure class. The Holiday decorations made it festive and cozy. I really want those flocked trees!! LOL Absolutely gorgeous. The pictures of this listing does it NO JUSTICE!! Rob is a delight and one of thee most gracious hosts I have encountered. His level of hospitality is unparalleled and he gave us some great suggestions of local eateries in the area. His home is in great proximity to downtown and other neighborhoods. We truly could not be more pleased and dreaded leaving to return back to our home state. However, we will certainly be back and definitely in the process of making plans to book Rob's home again. You will not be disappointed!! Truly his home is a GEM!!!",1.0
Chicago,"The warmest home we've ever been in. Sparkling clean, modern and superb interior design, great location and a very lovely, warm host. Thank you, Rob and we promise to only stay at your place whenever we're in Chicago! An experience to remember!",1.0
Chicago,"This was the cleanest Airbnb we’ve ever stayed in. If you are picky with finding a clean place that actually FEELS clean, this home is for you. You can immediately tell that Rob takes pride in his apartment and everything is so well maintained and stylishly decorated. The bed was a welcomed place for rest after a long day, and we loved how firm the mattress was and how fluffy the pillows were—very comfortable.  The amenities were spot on, the coffeemaker, the gas stove, plenty of dishes and quality cookware to use for making a meal. Not mention, the exceptional decor of the entire apartment! The location was excellent and walkable to numerous local restaurants and bars (a few were literally steps from the apartment door). We loved being on the third floor and always felt super safe. There is some traffic noise that can be heard in the bedroom, but Rob provides earplugs for light sleepers. In truth, we actually enjoyed being lulled to sleep by the sounds of the city and it didn’t bother us at all. The convenience of the grocery store being a 5 minute walk away made buying some pantry and fridge essentials easy. The couch in the living room was super comfy and perfect for relaxing and watching the Thanksgiving Day parade and some Netflix Christmas movies. This was the perfect Airbnb and we were highly impressed (not always easy). 5 stars to Rob for such an amazingly clean, comfortable, stylish, and well thought out home away from home. We’ll be back soon!",1.0
Chicago,"This place is so much nicer in person! And wow the bed was so comfortable we ended up sleeping the first night we got there instead of going out because we got trapped in the bed lol. Communicating with Rob was very easy and his home was supplied with everything!! First aid kit, make up remover wipes you name it lol. The home is in a very quiet and safe neighborhood. Would definitely stay again, one of the nicest places I have ever stayed!",1.0
Chicago,"We had a short but wonderful stay at Rob's place for a weekend trip to Chicago. Communication and check-in were quick and easy, and it was a breeze to get there from the airport on the train and a bus.  The space was spotlessly clean and beautifully furnished, with thoughtful touches that made our stay really comfortable. The location is great too, with a grocery store nearby and lots of good food/drink options as well.  Our only regrets are that we didn't stay here longer to enjoy it more and that we had to catch a Sunday morning flight before we could peruse the beautiful store downstairs some more. We would definitely stay here again, and will happily recommend it to any family and friends who may be looking for a place to stay in Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"Rob’s apartment was exactly what we need for a wonderful stay in Chicago. It was styled beautifully and Rob provided everything we could possibly need- thought of everything!

Chicago,"This might be my favorite Airbnb stay to date. The apartment so stunning, clean, and comfortable and charming Ukrainian Village with so much to offer, we chose to make fewer trips into the heart of the city to spend more time enjoying and exploring the immediate surroundings both in and out of the apartment. Yoga, restaurants, shops, grocery...everything within walking distance and this little oasis to temporarily call home. Rob couldn’t have been a better host. Will be back for sure!",1.0
Chicago,Rob’s place was amazing. Right in the center of everything. The location was close to many restaurants and bars. It is also a short ride to surrounding neighborhoods and downtown.

The parking space was a bonus as it is hard to find parking in this neighborhood without a permit.,1.0
Chicago,"Location, atmosphere, beautiful decor, every thought to amenities (even a First Aid Kit!)... you simply can't go wrong with this great condo in Ukrainian Village.  It was a snowy weekend so we especially enjoyed the cabinet full of games!  We were visiting family in Streeterville and getting there was no problem at all.  Rob greeted us when I arrived, and check-out was very simple.  Also, my brother drove over from a neighboring city to meet me, so we appreciated the off-street parking for him and his daughter.  Stay with Rob!  You won't regret it.",1.0
Chicago,"This is a stylish, modern yet comfortable apartment located in a cool part of town with lots of options to dine and a young at heart hip vibe.

Extremely clean. Special touches such as video games and snacks. Went above and beyond to provide a welcoming and safe environment. Room was stylized, modern. Plenty of amenities, even access to laundry. If we make our way back to town, we’ll stay here again. Thank you for making our first AirBNB memorable!",1.0

Having central heat as well as a space heater in the unit helped make sure we stayed nice and toasty during our visit. We didn't take advantage of them, but the fact that a washer and dryer were available was a nice bonus.   We'll definitely look here first on our next trip to Chicago!",1.0

He left a light on for me the night I arrived since I had a super late flight. He even checked in on me the next day to make sure I had everything I needed. The place was totally spotless. The bed was very comfy and there were tons of extra pillows. The kitchen was fully equipped and he even stocked it with several quick food items. These were much appreciated especially the first morning. The space felt so much more roomy than I was expecting. Ceilings are a bit lower being a garden unit but I had no problem at all with it. The water pressure in the shower was really great. Christopher made a really detailed welcome guide with lots of great info abt the neighborhood. The studio is only 3 short blocks away from a bus that takes you directly to the belmont el station (abt a 20-30 min ride). I felt very safe in the neighborhood (family vibe) even when coming in using transit late at night by myself. If you are wanting to do a lot of things in the Loop, transit took me 45-hour sometimes depending on the time of day. This was not a big deal for me bc I wanted a neighborhood experience vs more of a downtown touristy one, but it did take longer to get to and from. Lastly, Christopher was kind enough to  hold my luggage for me on my last day since I had a later flight. All in all, fantastic experience and I highly recommend this listing. Thank you so much, Christopher!",1.0
Chicago,Christopher’s place was was everything I could have hoped for. It was a nice cozy place where my girlfriend and I felt immediately at home. Everything was spotless and even had fruits and sparkling water. Christopher is an amazing host and I would definitely stay there again and recommend to anyone! Thanks again for everything Christopher,1.0
Chicago,This is such a great place to stay! Awesome location between the airport and downtown. Uber’s were always there within 5 minutes and were reasonably priced for a ride to anywhere in the city. We really appreciated the snacks and food prep materials that were there and having the ability to make our own food when away from home. Chris was very responsive and was flexible with check in/check out times in relation to our flights. The accommodations were more than we were expecting! Highly recommend!,1.0
Chicago,"I would highly recommend staying at Christopher's place. It is clean, the bed was super comfy and had a lot of pillows.

Above and beyond amenities, plenty of towels, pillows, even snacks and basic kitchen supplies!   I would be so happy to stay here again.",1.0
Chicago,Christopher’s place was exactly what we needed for our three-night stay in Chicago for Riot Fest. The basement studio was clean and Christopher was very responsive.

Chicago,"I very much enjoyed Chris and Paul's home. The decor was nice, they had local food suggestions, snacks and drinks, and plenty of towels. Chris was always quick to respond and very helpful. The location was good and within walking distance of many places to eat. It's a quiet neighborhood but easy for an uber to get to and not far at all from nightlife in Logan Square. I would definitely recommend this air bnb.",1.0
Chicago,"Christhopher's and Paul's place are great Host my girlfriend and I could not ask for more. We were delighted by the apples and other goodies the host provide for their guest. The studio is everything and much more a comfortable place can be it was clean, welcoming, and it is located in a safe neighborhood. Transportation was nearby and made our rides to the city very convinient, also we got to explore more of it by using transportation. Chris and Paul were very effective communicators they responded within a few minutes of us sending a message. We will definetely book again  when we go back to visit our family in the Chicago area. Thanks again Chris and Paul!!!",1.0
Chicago,"We found this to be a much better alternative to expensive hotels. This apartment was private, quiet, and clean. Parking on the street was easy. Chris was very helpful and communicative. The water in the fridge was appreciated! We only stayed one night, but this place has everything you'd need for an extended stay. ",1.0
Chicago,Chris was an amazing host.  His place was very clean and better than we expected.  This was the wife’s first time visiting Chicago and she wasn’t disappointed as this place offers a lot of space for two guests.  Parking on the same street was hit and miss but that can be expected for a big city.  We took Lyft anytime we were visiting downtown Chicago.  It was nice to come and go as we pleased.  Chris responded very quickly to any messages that were sent.  I felt safe enough walking in the general neighborhood.  When we visit Chicago again this would definitely be the first choice.  Our first host cancelled which brought us to finding this gem.,1.0
Chicago,Could not have asked for a better space and location.  Outstanding customer service and friendliness from Chris.  Plus the money we spent even with Uber was less than half the cost of a hotel.  If I could give more than 5 stars I would.,1.0
Chicago,"Chris was a great host.  Nice touches like beverages and snacks in the fridge, full compliment of toiletries, etc.  Bed was firm and super comfortable for a convertible type sofa.  Not at all like a typical pull out bed.  I slept great.  Parking on the street was not a problem and the neighborhood felt super safe.  His place is a couple of miles from my daughter and definitely more convenient, comfortable, and affordable than any nearby hotel.",1.0
Chicago,"Christopher's place is great! It was very clean and comfortable. Check in was easy and Christopher was very easy to get in touch with.

Chicago,"I can't give Christopher enough praise! This was absolutely perfect for our first trip to Chicago and the basement studio was just wonderful! Not only was it incredibly clean, stocked with snacks and home-y touches, but it was very comfortable and Christopher was an amazing host. He was very open to helping us with our bags when we were a little early to check in and he held them for us so we could go explore the city and enjoy our visit. He was great at communicating with us in a professional and timely manner, and his place was extremely clean and organized. We really made the right decision by staying here! We hope to come back to the area and we will be looking to stay here again! I would recommend to anyone coming to the area! ",1.0

Chicago,"Chris' place is really lovely! Plenty of space for 2 people, with lots of thoughtful touches like biscuits, bottled water, tea and coffee etc! The kitchen was well equipped to make meals, and Chris quickly provided a can opener when we asked to borrow one. The washer and dryer in the apartment were also very handy. Good location in a residential neighbourhood, about 10-15 min walk to the local Aldi and 10 mins to shops, including the currency exchange to get bus tickets. 5 mins walk from the bus stop that takes you to the blue line, which then takes you to O'hare airport or downtown. It takes around an hour to get to the Museum campus, and about 45 mins to attractions like the Skydeck and Hancock Tower. Chris recommended an architecture boat tour which was fab. Communication was always fast and helpful, would definitely recommend!",1.0

Chicago,"Samantha’s place was perfect for our short stay! It was very clean, stylish and cozy. The small, secluded patio was a sweet surprise.

We would love to stay again.",1.0

Chicago,"Samantha’s place is modern cute chic. Every piece of furniture is well thought out with aesthetic and function in mind. The steps to the loft bedroom: first, it’s very roomy up there and cozy. The steps itself could be problematic for people who are afraid of heights but for someone like me who is uncoordinated, it was surprisingly easy to navigate. Although, I didn’t need anything, Samantha made me feel like she was only an email/text/phone call away if I needed assistance or info. Also, there’s a small but very cute balcony where u can enjoy your morning coffee.",1.0
Chicago,Fun spot to serve as base camp to explore Chicago as you can reach a bunch of fun neighborhoods inside of 30 min. The unit itself was extremely clean and Samantha was super responsive.

Chicago,"Samantha & Jonathan's loft was exactly as pictured, and located in a convenient location. I loved the apartment - I would love to live here myself! The stairs to the loft was quite steep as others describe, and I left my suitcase downstairs and only went upstairs to sleep. The bed was very comfortable. My friend whom I stayed with wanted an easy access to the bathroom during night, so she decided to use the air mattress downstairs, which we found in the closet (we moved furnitures around to make space). The walk to the California CTA station was 15-20 min for me, but since it was quite a cold week, I often opted for Uber. As we had packed plans in downtown, we did not get to explore much of the neighborhood nor get to ask for neighborhood tips that Samantha was happy to share, but I'd love to come back to this loft and explore more!",1.0
Chicago,"The loft is located in a great quiet spot that is walking distance from great restaurants and bars. It was a ~15 minute walk from both the Logan Square and California blue line stops, and extremely close to tons and tons of good restaurants and bars (check out Lula, Giant, and Longman & Eagle). Samantha was a great host and the place was spotless when we arrived, with tea and some nice snacks sitting on the table. Checking in and out was as easy and quick as it gets, and we appreciated Samantha periodically messaging us to check on our experience. We would stay here again in a heartbeat. Our only warning is that all the stairs in the building are extremely steep and narrow. We didn't have any problems, but you should be careful. Overall a 5/5 experience.",1.0
Chicago,"The space is exactly as pictured.  Simple, basic, perfect for one or two people.  The bed in the loft was comfortable and the HDTV had plenty of premium channels.  The neighborhood is quiet and we felt safe.  Parking on the street wasn't an issue for us, but it did seem to be full in the evening.  Major bus line is 3 blocks away that will take you straight to the northside Fullerton train stops and the Blue Line station that goes to the loop is about 8 blocks away.  The host is easily reached and communication was great.  Thanks!",1.0
Chicago,"I enjoyed my stay in this space! The studio itself was very clean and quiet during sleeping hours. The staircase to the bed was a little steeper than I had expected, but it was sturdy and I got used to it. It was in a lovely location that had access to buses and trains. I did do a bit of walking, but that was my choice. Samantha and Jonathan were quick with communication and gave suggestions for the area. I would stay again. Thanks!",1.0

Chicago,"Samantha's place is absolutely marvelous! It's located in a nice residential area, with some fun bars and restaurants in the neighborhood. If you don't want to wait for a bus, it's a bit of a walk to the blue line, but nothing bad. Uber rides into the city were not that expensive and an easy way to get into the city. The apartment itself is really, really nice. Clean, spacious and an extremely comfy bed. I would highly recommend it to anybody!",1.0

Local amenities were perfect (I'd recommend Tony's for any grocery requirement and Wyler Road for a chilled drink and a bit to eat!) and not too far from the ""L"" to the Loop where it's a 20 min ride in.   Hosts were great and very responsive to any request and requirement we had and helped out as much as possible.  The stairs up to the mezzanine are definitely steep but we expected this from the description so not a problem at all and the apartment is carefully thought out to give maximum usability of the space.  Overall a fantastic expperience of this amazing city.",1.0

Furthermore, she always responded very quickly to questions from us. We ran in to her husband Jonathan a couple of times who was also super friendly and gave us a ton of advice on what to do in the city.

Chicago,"Lovely loft studio, spotlessly clean and very well designed with everything we needed. Location is good with the metro about 15 mins walk away then 20 mins to downtown, and a Chicago bike scheme station 5mins away and an even quicker cycle to downtown.

Chicago,Beautiful apartment in quite neighborhood. The space is great it's location relative to public transit is awesome. Samantha was quick to respond to any questions. I will definitely be checking availability next time I'm back in Chicago.,1.0
Chicago,"We had a great stay at Logan Square. The appartment was spacious (more so than we expected) and very clean with thoughtful provisions provided.   Samantha and Jonathon provided us with a great list of nearby places do eat and drink (from fresh coffee to pizza) and were very helpful in communicating when we asked for help.   Logan Sqaure itself is a lovely leafy neighbourhood around half an hr from Downtown on the train. There's plenty of amenities a short walk from the appartment, as well as loads of great bars. A taxi into Downtown is quicker but more expensive.   The 'L' (elevated train) is a 15-20 min walk from the appt and then a further 15 min or so ride into downtown where there is plenty to do. A weekly ticket for the train is around $30 and gives you access to trains and buses. Very handy for getting around as the bus and L system is easy to use.  On a clear day, we would recommend hiring a bike and taking the Lake Shore route which runs alongside Lake Michigan. You get stunning views of the iconic skyscrapers from across the water.  Hancock Tower on a clear day is also a must see too, with great views for miles.  If the weather is cooler, then there are loads of great museums to visit. the History of Chicago by Lincoln Park is great. The Old Town is nearby for a drink afterwards too.  Definitely a great city to visit with lots to do, and a great appartment in a great neighbourhood. 10/10  Thanks",1.0
Chicago,"The apartment was lovely, clean, and the coffee/snacks were appreciated. The security within the apartment was great, and although the surrounding area was less confidence-inspiring, she had us send a photo of our car once we arrived, and the area had cameras, so it put me at ease. We were super close to both bus and train options that we utilized several times, and within walking distance of target for quick pick-ups. We enjoyed our stay!",1.0
Chicago,"Kay is the best superhost you will ever have!! She is great with communication and is very welcoming! Her apartment has a home-like feeling that will make your vacation even better. Cleanest place ever!! Absolutely spotless and smells amazing!!  If you are looking for suggestions of where to eat and shop, Kay will give you a list of her favorite places and provides a variety brochures, pamphlets, flyers, and food menu’s! I had mentioned my family was vegan and she gave me options of food choices around the area!  Great location!!! I highly recommend staying at Kay’s place if you are visiting Chicago!!",1.0
Chicago,"Kay’s place was very cute and clean!! She was super quick to respond to anything. The train is a quick walk from the apartment though I don’t think I would personally feel safe walking from the train tooo late at night as a young lady.

Chicago,"Even though Kay's place was more on the south side of Chicago and I was going to the north side for a Cubs game, her place was great for a one-night stay with how reasonably priced it was right before Memorial Day weekend. I just got ubers to get to and from the game rather than public transit. Kay's place was very comfortable and she was a great host!",1.0
Chicago,"Kay’s place was amazing! Such thoughtful, kind touches, and Kay is super communicative. Seriously, this room was nicer and more well-equipped than some of the luxury hotel’s I’ve stayed at. 100% would stay here again!",1.0
Chicago,"From the extreme cleanliness of the apartment to the added extras everywhere you turn, this place was absolutely perfect! The host is respectful and generous with the most friendly senior kitty ever! Coming “home” to a snuggly feline in the living room was probably the best thing ever (I’m an extreme cat person). However, if you’re not into cats, no worries; the cat isn’t pushy and you could probably spend your entire trip ~not~ seeing him if that’s more your style. The off-street parking was clean and safe, something that can be hard to secure in Chicago. The apartment is located very close to both the train and the bus, making in-city traveling quite easy. I would highly recommend this AirBnB!",1.0
Chicago,It’s a wonderful and comfortable place to stay. Kay is really great at communicating with guests and is super nice and welcoming. The space is very clean and has a nice charm to it.

Chicago,I extremely enjoyed my stay at Kay's place.  The location is perfect. My favorite part was having a Target with a Starbucks and market near by. This place is also closely located to a CTA and the freeway entrance if you have a car.  Kay provides many good ameneties and I was very happy for that. She is quickly responsive and super helpful. I'm glad I got to meet her. She is a sweet person.  It is 15 min away from the city.    Also if you have a rental/car there is parking near by!!!  Thanks Kay,1.0
Chicago,"Five stars isn’t enough! Kay made me feel very welcome and comfortable. I felt as if I was staying with family or an old friend, definitely not a stranger. She provided breakfast and coffee for me before I headed out and it definitely gave me a great start. I have a cat at my place, so their friendly lil guy made me feel even more at home. I would definitely recommend her to anyone else and will definitely stay with her again if the opportunity arises.",1.0
Chicago,"I was pleasantly surprised by how amazing the experience turned out to be at Kay's home. The entire house felt inviting and immediately puts you at ease. She puts the guest first and it shows in her thoughtful approach to outfitting the room. From soft bath towels and a loofah at your bedside, to the coffee and tea bar in the kitchen for hot drinks in the morning. She really wants you to feel like you are taken care of the moment you walk in the door. The location is convenient with good selection of restaurants in the area to choose from and downtown is a hop and a skip away for those who want to take in the sights. If it isn't obvious already,  I highly recommend staying with Kay during your trip to Chicago!",1.0
Chicago,"I stayed at Kay's place with two of my friends over St. Pat's weekend. The free parking was a huge blessing, and the apartment was very close to the CTA for local travel. The apartment itself was clean and well-kept. Kay was a wonderful host! From giving us travel recommendations to providing some St. Patrick's day accessories, she made our stay as enjoyable as possible.

Also, there were loads of local brochures and magazines to browse. Her 16 year old cat Toby is such a love! He was super friendly and sweet.

Chicago,"Kay provided a great Airbnb!

Chicago,Kay is an Amazing host with an air bnb that makes you feel at home! The entire house is sparkling clean and full of creative and cute decor.

Chicago,"Kay is an absolute pro of a host.  She communicated check-in instructions very clearly and regularly  touched-base to make sure I had everything I needed during my stay.  Her place is ideally situated a mere 5 minute walk from an L train station (which is a fantastic way to get around Chicago as I discovered).  Very comfortable, clean, and safe place to spend your nights when visiting Chicago-- can't recommend enough.",1.0
Chicago,"The misfortune of staying at Kay's is that one will quickly realize that not every host will be like her! :-/ I was able to take the train (as she pre-stay suggested) directly out of midway and walk about 2 blocks & if cleanliness is next to godliness, then trust Kay has you covered. And to be completely honest, Kay extended herself to me in an act that goes way beyond the scope of AirBnb. I was comfortable, I felt safe, the room was very dedicated. Being that she was my 1st AirBnb experience,  I really feel like I lucked up. Omg, and her snack bar (fresh yummies), were too delish! :-* #BookHer",1.0
Chicago,"Kay is a fantastic host and I can not recommend her enough. When we contacted her for anything we needed, the response was lightning-fast!

If you’re looking for a great experience for a really reasonable price, definitely book with Kay!",1.0
Chicago,"If I could give 6 stars I would. Kay's place was immaculate, cute, comfortable, easy to access — everything you could ask for in an Airbnb.

If you want explore the Logan Square neighborhood or just want a nice place with easy access to downtown, I’d definitely recommend staying here.",1.0
Chicago,"This has got to be in the top two best airbnb experiences I've had. Danielle's place is so cozy and looks amazing. We ended up spending a lazy Sunday lounging inside by the fireplace and watching dumb movies - an ideal way to spend a day after heavy touristing Friday and Saturday. She was incredibly accommodating throughout our stay with complications our party had with check in and check out. The surrounding area had an incredible pizza place, a bar where we got boozy ice cream floats, some breweries, and way more that we didn't have time to discover because we didn't want to leave the fire. Will 100% look to stay here again in the future!",1.0

Chicago,This was a truly desperate search for a safe place for my daughter to stay last minute while out of town.  She made last minute plans to travel to Chicago for the Gold Cup soccer match.  Once there she could not find a hotel to rent to her because she is 18.  She was in her car crying.  I booked with Jim on the internet and spoke with him by phone.  He was so great!!!  He met her and her boyfriend at the door.  He even spoke Spanish with her boyfriend which made him feel great.  He assured me by phone about how safe the neighborhood  was and that he would be on the premises just a moments notice away.  He treated them like adults but still helped me feel comfortable about their safety knowing they will always be my babies.  It was truly above and beyond.  And my daughter said the apartment was gorgeous.,1.0

We liked this, it felt cozy and being on the ground floor was very convenient. The design of the kitchen and living room is very nice, the bedrooms are comfortable and private. Took a few baths, nice bathroom. It was very quiet, almost no street noise. Just a few blocks from Clark street and a few more to the train. We loved staying here!",1.0

Chicago,"Jim & Maximo’s apartment is beautiful & well located. This was our 3rd visit to Chicago for a girls weekend; first time in Andersonville. Nice quiet neighborhood with Uber/lyft convenience to most city locations in 15-20 min. Apartment is on ground floor, some street noise but overall very quiet. Neighborhood is safe with quick walks to great eating spots. We recommend the little red wolf & mhenry.  Apartment is well furnished with nice appliances & conveniences, great WiFi. Host was attentive, but only needed on day 1: we’re pretty low key. Only recommendation would be additional blankets/ linens for pull out couch in living area.",1.0

Chicago,"Our stay in Chicago was great and we really enjoyed staying in Andersonville. It was far enough away to be quiet but only a 12-15 minute walk to the train station, which we didn’t mind at all. The neighborhood felt safe enough to walk in and we liked the local coffee shops and restaurants.   The apartment was nicely decorated and clean. I would just give a heads up that if you’re a light sleeper you can hear the hosts upstairs because it’s an old building. I would never take away a star for this because it’s just a personal thing. My wife is a heavy sleeper and it never bothered her but I had to download a white noise app on my phone to fall asleep.   The hosts were great communicators and asked if we needed anything and how our stay was going. We both enjoyed it and would stay here again!",1.0
Chicago,"Jim's place is just as pictured and described and was a lovely, comfortable, clean and quiet place to stay while I visited family and friends in the Chicago area.

Chicago,"Jim's place was FANTASTIC. The place was exactly what we expected it to be from the fabulous photos which were 100% accurate showing off the truly lovely and well decorated apartment. Very clean, well appointed, extra towels and pillows, fantastic magazines for relaxing reading, GREAT map of the local neighborhood in order to find fantastic local shops and places to eat.  You can totally get around on public transit (mostly CTA Bus) from this apartment. Note: the place is a little far from the CTA train stations into downtown. We rented a car and really appreciated the flexibility to get around the city easily and great neighborhood street parking.   The apartment is well appointed with everything you need for your stay. One of the bedrooms is street facing but there is not much traffic so it stayed very quiet at night. Air conditioning for the summer time is a huge plus on muggy hot days!  Andersonville neighborhood is one of my favorite areas of Chicago. It is quaint, full of local  charm, great eats and drinks within walking distance, and a fantastic way to get a feel of what real Chicago is like (and not the fake touristy stuff). Off the beaten path geek thing we did - we drove to and walked through the nearby Rosehill Cemetery Mausoleum. The old original section has a substantial collection of LC Tiffany stained glass windows and walking the completely silent hallways to see the sun shining through these beautiful windows is pretty awesome if you like that sort of thing.  Love Jim's place! Beyond 5 stars! We will hopefully be back to town and rent out his apartment again in the future. ",1.0

It's very close to all the Andersonville shops and restaurants on Clark St. and a short walk to the el stop to go downtown; it's in a lovely, quiet, leafy neighborhood of brownstones. Parking was easy -- there was street parking right outside the apartment; we parked the car when we arrived Friday and didn't need to move it or use it until we left on Sunday. The apartment was very clean and well-appointed, with a great kitchen and nice amenities. Jim was there to give us the keys when we checked in; he and Maximo were available if needed but also gave us space. We'd highly recommend this one!",1.0

This is a great apartment with caring and involved hosts. I recommend staying here unconditionally!",1.0
Chicago,"The apartment was beautiful and very spacious. There are restaurants, grocery stores and pharmacies within walking distance. The neighborhood seemed very safe and we enjoyed walking around even in the cold weather. The Keurig and snack basket were nice touches which we appreciated. The beds were  too firm to be comfortable for me, but my boyfriend was fine with it, so it may be personal preference. Jim and Maximo were very attentive and always ready to help. Please note, the apartment does not have a microwave. Also, there is a policy that you cannot have any guest enter into the apartment (not just for sleeping, but for visiting too) which I misunderstood when booking, but it was not a problem since it was only the two of us. If you're traveling in a group or with family staying in other places, you may want to look for another place if you want them to be able to visit you. Overall our stay was lovely and we would recommend this apartment.",1.0

The location was great, since I had just been staying downtown at a conference prior to my stay it was nice to get out a bit and see some other neighborhoods. I could easily walk to the 606 Trail - which I really enjoyed - and N Milwaukee Ave for some fun shopping. I appreciated the guide they had in the studio with local recommendations listed, I got take-out from the Indian place down the street and it was delicious. Very comfortable bed!",1.0
Chicago,"Elinor went above and beyond to accommodate our stay, the level of hospitality was excellent!   The space is gorgeous and welcoming. I love that every detail was thought out, and this carries out throughout all the pieces in the home. Definitely a gem in the city.",1.0
Chicago,"Loved my stay here! Very comfortable bed, very clean, artistic space, thoughtful books and postcards, easy check in and out. Highly recommend staying here if you want to be in the Wicker Park area of Chicago!",1.0
Chicago,"I absolutely loved this place! I already told my sister that when we get the chance to go to Chicago together we will absolutely have to stay there. It was the perfect size and had everything I needed. The style of the whole place was gorgeous. I can tell a lot of thought went into creating this space. The shower and bathtub were amazing, and it was very helpful that there was a hair dryer, shampoo/conditioner, body wash, etc. When I do get the chance to travel to Chicago again I hope this is available. I can’t say enough about how much I loved this place!",1.0
Chicago,"From the incredibly easy check in and location, to the thoughtful touches that made us feel at home, to the impeccably curated style, we absolutely loved stayed here. It will be our go to any time we are back in Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"What can I say except that Elinor’s place was great! The little touches, such as welcome beers, pour over coffee, books on Chicago, and available toilet trees (we flew in and only had carry-one) were perfect. We only used the room for sleeping since we spent most of our day and night exploring the city! The weather is Chicago sure is unpredictable and crazy, so make sure you have a jacket or umbrella on stand by! Haha Thank you again for allowing us to stay in your lovely place!",1.0
Chicago,"We loved this place! It has all of the amenities and comfort of a nice hotel and more. The space was stunning, just like the photos. It felt very private which was great. We appreciated all of the books about Chicago and local restaurants. We’ll be back!",1.0
Chicago,This place is exactly as it looks! Super cute with personal touches so you know you’re getting an authentic experience. It’s close enough to the L to make traveling to and from the city accessible! Would for sure stay here again; wish I had more time :),1.0
Chicago,"OMG this place is so fantastic. It's PERFECT. I'm going to stay here again for sure! Great location, excellent host, so stylish and cool. The place also comes with an amazing little booklet to tell you how to use the WiFi and coffeemaker, and how to get around.",1.0
Chicago,"If I had more a sense of self-interest, I would write the  worst review ever so that this amazing space is always available for me when I'm in Chicago. First: it is it's own little building in the city. Wow! It's designed so beautifully, I took tons of photos to inspire my guest house back in CT. Elinor was responsive, accommodating, and super nice. I'm spreading the word to all of my friends who are jazzed staying there. The location is 10-12 minutes from downtown... well worth it for these gorgeous accommodations. BTW: the photos don't really capture the details and inviting sweetness of the place. I'll see you again, Elinor!",1.0
Chicago,"Ellie and Devin's space is charming! It's a well-designed, well-maintained large studio with incredibly thoughtful touches: books about the history of Chicago, more books from Chicago based writers and poets, games, postcards, and even stamps. I was a little nervous the first night with the studio being so close to the street, but I slept like a dream – the bed is comfortable and the studio is airy and bright. The place is exactly as pictured, even better. Ellie and Devin were very responsive and helpful. I would definitely come back and highly recommend staying here.",1.0
Chicago,This place is in the best part of the city! So easy to walk everywhere! It is clean with amazing amenities! The cute little touches! The great bath and shower! The delicious pour-over coffee! I want to stay there again.,1.0
Chicago,Elinor’s apartment is the perfect place for a cozy and stylish stay in Chicago. Everything we could’ve needed was provided and Elinor’s neighborhood recommendations were superb! I would highly recommend this place to anyone wanting to visit Chicago (and to avoid tourist traps)!,1.0
Chicago,"I can’t say it enough- this is THE best Airbnb I’ve ever stayed at and is so cozy! It’s worth every penny! I came to take my boards and it was just perfect for the stay. It’s so stylish, quaint, adorable neighborhood, and the little touches are unlimited! There was wine and beer stocked in the fridge, a cute pour over coffee pot and trader joe beans with a grinder! Basically I’m sad I can’t just move and stay in forever. People always say, “oh I’ll be back” but this is serious, I can’t wait to book again! I have best friends who live in the city and I’d still pay to stay in this awesome space! Airbnb MVP! Don’t hesitate! Book it now!",1.0
Chicago,"What you see on the photos are absolutely accurate and more! Loved the open space, high ceilings and obviously the bath. I've been using Airbnb for most of my travels and this is one of the nicest and most aesthetically pleasing location I have ever stayed at!",1.0
Chicago,"My fiancé and I were in town to celebrate our anniversary weekend. We couldn't have picked a better place to stay. The open layout, soft lighting, and claw foot tub all made it seem like a dream. Thank you so much!",1.0
Chicago,"Ellie was fantastic, super fast responses to my emails. Her place was fantastic, and right in the neighborhood where we needed to be. Hate to say this, but she could easily get more per night given the location and how awesome the space is.   Cheers!",1.0
Chicago,"Great place! Great host! We actually had major delays on our flight out of Chicago and she offered for us to stay another night. We felt loved and cared for. If you want a spot not in the downtown hustle but still in the city enough to Uber for good rates, look no further. Quiet neighborhood. Pictures described the space very accurately. It was the perfect space for a quick getaway to Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"Amazing and beautiful first airbnb experience. The place was decorated very modern and was clean. Both the walk in shower and claw-foot tub were great and the water got very hot. The bed was super comfy! There were plenty of towels, extra sheets, and blankets to use as well. There were also nice personal touches such as food recommendations and stocked beverages in the fridge (water filter, coffee, and some wine). Me and my boyfriend had an amazing time.",1.0
Chicago,"Wonderful place to stay while visiting the windy city of Chicago! Not far from great restaurant, bars, shopping and downtown. The coach house is decorated to perfection in mid-century modern decor and very clean. My husband and I used Uber all weekend and waiting no longer than 2 min. for a pickup at the house.  Highly recommend a stay at this location.",1.0
Chicago,"Great place to stay in Chicago. The space is very functionable and artsy, open and airy- we loved it. Comfy bed, all amenities you would want and then far more are provided. There are even beautiful post cards for you to write home with! Highly recommend it!",1.0
Chicago,Ellie’s place is exactly what you see in the all - no false advertising. It’s very light and open and she maximizes the space greatly. She’s very easy to communicate with. The Damen & Western L stations are close enough walk which we utilized a lot. Would definitely stay here again!,1.0
Chicago,"Gorgeous! I loved staying here. It was in a cool neighborhood and the studio was clean, styled well, and the bathroom was top notch. I want to stay here every time I come back to Chicago. They also have postcards and stamps for your use. Sweet little detail. Thanks so much!",1.0
Chicago,"This is a fantastic place. Super bright, extremely clean, great design, and extremely comfortable. Parking was easy. Check in and check out were super convenient and Elinor was very responsive. Can’t recommend highly enough!",1.0
Chicago,Eleanor's place was fantastic! Every detail was thought of including the courtesy postcards depicting her cat who sits in the window in the house on Artesian Street on the front. I would come back to Chicago just to hang out in this cool Studio for a weekend.,1.0
Chicago,"This is a gem of a space that is a close walk to some great cafes, shopping, and night life. As someone who travels a fair amount, I would say this was one of my favorite stays at an AirBNB. The space itself is very thoughtfully curated. ",1.0
Chicago,"There is a reason so many reviews start with how stylish the place is. That reason is because it is stunning and just as advertised! The level of detail and thought put in to the design is unbelievable.   Location is great, quick walk to the blue line. Check in/out is super easy, and the studio manual made our interactions minimal.   Great place to stay, will absolutely repeat.   Thanks again!",1.0
Chicago,"This place was great. It's worth the price just to swim around in that huge bathtub. Ellie was a great host, and the apartment had everything you could need for a great time in Chicago. I found most places I needed to go (food, cute shops, metro) to be about a ~10 min walk away, which I don't mind because I love to walk, but if you don't consider getting a car. It was really easy to get to downtown using the train. I have no complaints, this was an awesome  place!",1.0
Chicago,"This is such a cute, clean and comfortable space! I could stay here for weeks! Nice little neighborhood. Had initially worried about noise at night, but it did quiet down for a restful evening.  The fresh ground coffee, sodas, beer help to make it comfortable. Nice distance from downtown. Safe to run in the mornings with a park nearby. Love this place!",1.0
Chicago,"Ellie’s studio is absolutely stunning! She goes above & beyond for her guest! There are loads of local nicknacks laying around the studio to indulge into. She has her cabinets stocked with things one might need (ibuprofen, cotton swabs, razors, etc). The neighbor hood is very nice. There are not many of taxi’s in the area, so if you don’t drive one might want to download uber. Definitely worth the stay! Would definitely come back!",1.0
Chicago,"Fantastic stay! The studio was as pristine as pictured. You felt more like you were staying in a hotel than someone's home. Great amenities like shampoo, soft towels and even yoga mats! Would highly recommend,",1.0
Chicago,"Elinor's studio was a magical place, and I could tell as I soon as I stepped up to the door, because care was taken in styling the exterior with little faerie lights that sparkled. I hate to say this, but I can be a bit of snob when it comes aesthetic and decor. I have not one complaint about this studio. I was absolutely blown away. The incredible level of detail and design, even down to the studio's handbook was meticulous and thought out.  What's even more wonderful is the central location to all the haunts in the Bucktown/Wicker Park area. I drove and literally everywhere I went was less than a 10 minutes away. I can't imagine that taking public transportation would take any longer. If you do drive, Elinor provides a parking permit, which gives you the freedom to park anywhere in the vivinity without the fear of getting a ticket.  By far Elinor's place is one of the best spots I've stayed in for Air BnB. If you're looking for something magical and romantic (oh, I forgot to mention there's wonderfully restored claw-foot Victorian bath tub) look no further.",1.0
Chicago,Stayed here while visiting Chicago. The apartment was really clean and cozy and located in a really good location for our trip. We were able to park right out front for our stay and walk everywhere. If you're looking to spend time in the Ukrainian Village i would recommend staying here. Close to the train if ya want to travel other places too.,1.0
Chicago,"The initial observation of the space was of course a stylish space for a reasonable price.  Seeing the space in person is such an enjoyable experience - especially when noticing all the fine details not revealed in the online pics.  It is in those details that raises the level of impression and sets it apart from other spaces.    Elinor and I had minimal contact, but that was because instructions were clear on the check-in and check-out procedures, where to park, and even how to make the coffee - which we were thoroughly confused at first.    I enjoy exploring different places to stay when visiting areas, but I would consider staying here again on my next trip to Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"I enjoyed my stay at Elinor's studio apartment in Wicker Park.  The location was pefect for me.  The studio was quite stylish and had many personal touches, including a studio manual which I found quite helpful and fun.  I really appreciated the 2 bottles of wine and the beer selection in the fridge.  The kitchen was minimal but that was fine with me because I planned to enjoy Chicago's dining scene.  The bed was  very confortable, which was a definite plus.  The heater was somewhat louder than I was expecting, but that is the only concern I had.  I would definitely stay here again.",1.0
Chicago,"This is a great spot. Located near hip Wicker Park and related. Quiet, good access to Metro and very pleasant spot to hang out and do some work too. Hostess was very helpful on restaurants etc . This is a top BnB!!!",1.0
Chicago,"The space is exactly as described. Gorgeous. The bathroom is stylish, clean, and the shower is great. Would love to have a space like that in my own home tbh. They have cute touches throughout the studio, including Where Chefs Eat (I have that at home too!) and Studs Terkel's ""Working"" in the bathroom. The bed was really comfortable and once we figured out how to configure the NEST properly for our purposes, the temperature control was on point. One minor note is that both heat and cool air come out predominantly at the head of the bed, and it could be bothersome to people who are sensitive to dry air. My wife had to turn to the foot of the bed one night because she's super sensitive, but it didn't bother me much. The location was good for me because I don't need to be right downtown and don't mind taking a Lyft everywhere, plus I like to be in ""real"" neighborhoods. Puerto Rican restaurants abound as well as cool street art, if you care to venture around. It's about a twenty minute drive to many downtown area attractions. The hosts were very accommodating to my needs, as I had to cancel one day due to a family emergency. They were very easy to work with throughout. Will definitely look to return here my next stay in Chicago",1.0
Chicago,Elinor's place is close to perfect. Every corner of the space is thoughtfully detailed and styled. It's located very centrally to Logan Square and the Bucktown/Wicker Park area and I enjoyed walking the neighborhood in my downtime. Her communication was clear and extremely quick and I truly cannot say enough about how pleasant my stay was. Highly recommended.,1.0
Chicago,"Before I arrived, I loved the photos and thought the place would be perfect for my stay over New Year's. Walking in, it was somehow even better. From the furniture to the lighting to the tableware, everything in the space is very intentionally curated. I have a feeling the owners are designers; the whole place has a great aesthetic while still being comfortable. One of my favorite places I've stayed so far",1.0
Chicago,"We had a great stay at this charming, stylish studio. Clean digs and thoughtful touches like coffee, beer, and wine were lovely. Location was perfect for getting around town by foot or Lyft, yet the street itself was quiet and residential. Great host communication and simple check in and check out. Would stay again in a heartbeat!",1.0
Chicago,"I love this spot . The layout, decor and vibe are definitely hip. Everything is so easy + the communication with Elinor is on point. The amenities are great . The experience is very hommie , every time you discover little details that make a difference in your stay.   If you’re looking for something local, not loud ,  away from tourists this is definitely a good location.",1.0
Chicago,"Ellie’s place is so so wonderful! Chic, stylish, beautiful location from which you can easily access the trendiest Chicago area, Wicker Park. Ellie responds in mere minutes should you need anything and the keypad entry makes it so easy to come and go as you please, no need for keys! 10/10 would recommend and hope to stay here again! ❤️",1.0
Chicago,"Beautiful decor with so much space! Instructions for checkin were easy to follow. The coffee and extras were great!  Very comfortable bed! The apartment has an urban ambiance. Jeremy provided parking passes and we were able to find parking a block away. Communication was excellent. Jeremy answered any questions I had almost immediately. Neighborhood had a safe feel. We walked to local restaurants close by. One unfortunate thing, which was no fault of our host- when we went to leave, we discoveredthat our catalytic converter was stolen off of our car. I had driven our older SUV since I knew it would be parked for several days. Turns out, these are easiervehicles to get under and cut. I would not hesitate to stay here again.",1.0
Chicago,"This Airbnb is the best! Location and space are the key highlights! Jeremy has great design taste! Close to the train and many restaurants. We would definitely stay here again! If you’re visiting, try the rolled ice cream across the street! We had it twice!",1.0
Chicago,"The apartment was absolutely fantastic and everything was as good as advertised. The entire unit was much more spacious than it appeared in the photos which was a welcomed surprise as I have stayed in several Airbnb's that were smaller than photographed.   You could not ask for a better location, one block from the blue line which made traveling to/from O'Hare and into downtown a breeze. You're also within walking distance to countless top notch restaurants and shops.  Jeremy was a very responsive and accommodating host and he really made us feel taken care of when we had some flight plan changes. I would recommend this apartment to anyone wanting to visit Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"There is much to like about this apartment.  It's spacious, has full amenities, plenty of character, parking is included, and the place is clean.  Wicker Park is growing, has a unique vibe, feels safe, and offers options within walking distance for groceries.  The area also has many choices for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and drinks.  We chose to use the kitchen for breakfast, and the waffle maker was a great perk.  A critical factor in comfort, rest and relaxation is the bed.  While clean, we found the mattress to be uncomfortable.  It currently presents itself as firm and lumpy with indentations and sag from years of use.  Upgrading this one very important item would make this location, apartment, and experience worth renting again.  We enjoyed our stay overall and will keep this as an option in the future.",1.0
Chicago,"Came to Chicago for my cousin's birthday party. It was in my old neighborhood, so I felt very much at home. The place was spacious and exactly how it was described! I briefly meet Jeremy when I arrived, he was extremely nice. Would love to come back here when I visit Chicago again.",1.0
Chicago,"I loved this loft and everything about it.  The location was great - 1.5 blocks from the CTA - we were able to explore the entire city using public transportation.  Check in and check out were a breeze.  Jeremy was kind and offered great suggestions when we met briefly during the stay.  The apartment was spotlessly clean, comfortable, quiet and well appointed.  This was my first visit to Chicago and I would gladly stay here on my next trip.",1.0
Chicago,"We loved this place. It's spacious and very convenient. If you have small children, you may want to know that there is a firehouse nearby, but it did not bother us, we expected city noises. There's a Metro station barely a block away. It's great to have a washer and dryer right in the apartment since we tend to pack very lightly. We greatly appreciated the neighborhood parking stickers Jeremey provided and we easily found parking about 1 block away on a safe, residential street. We'll stay here again next time we're in town.",1.0
Chicago,"This is a large, 1 bedroom apartment within 2 blocks of the blue line. Very convenient! There’s a well equipped full kitchen with a small grocery across the street. Of course there a numerous great restaurants in the area so there’s no need to cook. The apartment was very comfortable and clean. We had plenty of pillows, blankets, towels etc. which was much appreciated.",1.0
Chicago,"This was my very first AirBnB and if all of them are like this one, I'll never stay in a hotel again. Jeremey's communication was excellent from start to finish and his home is so beautiful and immaculate. It is easy to find and right off the blue line. The home had EVERYTHING I needed and then some. He even left me 2 day parking passes for the area which made people coming by easy to park nearby. It is in a very cool neighborhood and as a single woman staying in an area I've never been, I felt very safe. When I visit again, I would definitely stay there again.",1.0
Chicago,Jeremey is a wonderful host and his place is extremely nice. He is quick to respond with any questions and is willing to give recommendations around the city. The place was clean and decorated with care. It has everything you would need during your stay.,1.0
Chicago,"Jeremy's apartment is exactly as advertised - stylish, large, comfortable and spotlessly clean in a very safe, hip neighborhood.  The kitchen has all you would need to fix your own meals.  We, however, opted to take advantage of the multitude of excellent bars, coffee shops and restaurants within very easy walking distance on Division Street and North Milwaukee Avenue (for lovers of high quality Nepalese / Indian food we recommend Cumin on North Milwaukee). Communication with Jeremy was very easy.  If and when we return to this part of Chicago Wicker we would, without hesitation choose to stay in Jeremy's place.",1.0
Chicago,"We were very pleased with the apartment. With an updated modern kitchen and bathroom we had everything we needed to be comfortable. Jeremy was a great host, communicated all details we needed when needed.",1.0
Chicago,Jeremy's place was fantastic! It is really big. Was great to unpack and have space and feel at home. Really close to the blue line. Easy to get anywhere. Felt safe in the neighborhood. Fire station next door but never bothered us or woke us up. Would definitely stay again!,1.0
Chicago,Our stay was great! Jeremey was very responsive when we asked him about accommodating our two dogs during the stay. There was even a small crate provided that we ended up using for the smaller pup. Everything was just as described and the apartment is close to many great restaurants and shops. We'd stay again! :),1.0
Chicago,"Jeremey's place is fantastic -- it's bigger than we were expecting and has a really nice overall feel to it.  It's nicely decorated and has all the amenities you would need.  Jeremey was very quick to respond to messages and helped out if anything at all was needed.  Check-in was simple and the building felt secure.  It's just a couple minutes' walk to the blue line, which brings you right into downtown in about 10 minutes.  Also close to some cool spots on N Milwaukee, like Oiistar, the amazing ramen place.  Super nice experience and we'd definitely stay with Jeremey again!",1.0
Chicago,"This was perfect for our needs.  Everything was as advertised.  It's a beautiful space and the location is great.  (Ashland itself is not too appealing but you're a one-minute walk from blue line, can stroll west on Division or walk up Milwaukee Ave to Bucktown.).  Self-checkin was super easy and we had everything we needed.",1.0
Chicago,"Jeremy was very responsive, answering all questions quickly and thoroughly.  His place was nice and very clean.  My parents stayed at the Air BnB to visit me and were quite pleased.  Being that I own and live in downtown Chicago, I can say that this location fantastic and the price to be a great value.",1.0
Chicago,This place is one of the nicest accommodations I have ever stayed at. Yes the price is expensive compared to a hotel but if you want a solid night's sleep and little slice of home be sure to check out Jeremy's place!,1.0
Chicago,Wonderful place.  We really enjoyed ourselves and relaxed at Jeremey's loft.  Very clean.  We enjoyed being able to watch people on the streets from the loft.  Love the mixture of cultures which we don't get much of back home.  Location was great.  Very quick walk to get to Wicker Park and many great local restaurants as well.  Felt very safe in the neighborhood and at Jeremey's place.  Super nice people.  Jeremey is fantastic at returning messages.  Always a quick reply and we had no problems at all that couldn't be fixed quickly.  Highly recommend Jeremey's loft!,1.0
Chicago,"Jeremey's apartment far exceeded our expectations.  The pictures don't do justice to how beautiful, stylish and very spacious this place is, not to mention comfortable and clean.  Everything was simply perfect.  Every possible amenity to make you feel right at home--we wanted for nothing.  Comfortable bed and couches, beautiful, roomy bathroom with large shower and plenty of hot water, fully stocked kitchen, excellent wi-fi and incredibly easy check-in process. We loved the location, merely 2 short blocks (roughly 3 min) walk to the Blue line on the L/ subway.  So easy to get to the main attractions downtown, but also in a great spot to explore the Wicker Park/ West Town neighborhoods and all the great restaurants and shops.  An excellent Airbnb experience--Thank you, Jeremey!!",1.0
Chicago,We found it exactly as advertised—perhaps even better. Super accommodations in a great location. Jeremey was very accessible and promptly responded to our requests and questions. We look forward to staying there again on our next trip to Chicago.,1.0
Chicago,We LOVED the location. The area seemed very safe and was central to the blue line and a Divvy bike station. (Tip: take the blue line to and from O’hare to save a lot of money on transportation) The apartment was very roomy and we enjoyed having access to a kitchen. Something to note is the TV does not have cable or “smart” access. We ended up buying a firestick so we had something to watch while winding down at the end of our days. Jeremy was quick to respond any time we had questions or needed anything! Thank you for a great stay!,1.0
Chicago,"Better than it looked online, a beautiful space with everything needed and then some. Great location, close to public transportation and wonderful local spots. Jeremy was attentive and helpful with all of my queries. Would stay here whenever I’m in Chicago. Can’t recom enough!",1.0
Chicago,"This is a beautiful unit in a great neighborhood in Chicago.  Jeremy was a great host and was easy to communicate with.  Check-in and check-out were a breeze and the apartment was spotless.  It's on a busy street but there was very little noise.  The blue line is a block away as are Target, CVS and a bunch of great coffee shops and places to eat.  Also super easy to pick up a cab or an Uber/Lyft.  Would recommend this place without hesitation!",1.0
Chicago,Communication was fast and easy and Jeremey was available every step of the way.    Apartment was better than I expected.  Great location and very close to the Blue Line which can get you just about anywhere.     Would absolutely recommend and would stay here again in the future.   ,1.0
Chicago,"This is a spacious apartment and very nicely furnished. The location is just a few minutes walk from the blue line with quick transportation direct to the heart of downtown. Check-in was easy and the host provided a sheet with lots of helpful suggestions for local eating places, of which there are many.  Staying at Jeremey's place for 4 nights provided a very comfortable place to stay for our tired bodies after spending our days exploring Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,Jeremey’s place is very spacious and clean.  It has everything you need for a short or long term stay.  Jeremey is very nice and answers any question very promptly.  The location is also very convenient for travel on public transport.  Highly recommended!,1.0
Chicago,"Couldn't have asked for a better place. It was super easy to get to and from both town and O'Hare, with a Blue Line stop only one block away. It was beautiful and cheerful as well. Loved the full kitchen and nice extra-large tub. Jeremey was a lovely host. I wish we could have stayed even longer!",1.0
Chicago,"Great location with convenient transportation. The neighborhood has a cool vibe. As a vinyl record collector, I was excited about being across the street from Dusty Groove and close to Reckless Records. Great overall experience.",1.0
Chicago,"My wife and I spent 2 nights at Jeremey's place. While pictures can often be deceiving, we were pleasantly surprised at how large and open the apartment was in person. It was perfect. Jeremey was traveling in Spain at the time, but he was quick to respond to questions we had the day of and during the trip about things such as checking in and adjusting the nest thermostat. We'd happily stay there again.",1.0
Chicago,Great space in a convenient location—a vibrant neighborhood and just a block from blue line. The apartment has a good vibe and personality and is very clean. Jeremy was attentive and responsive. I’ll go back.,1.0
Chicago,"Jeremey's apartment is really great. It's large and bright in all the right places (and quieter and darker in the bedroom, which is lovely for sleeping), stylishly decorated (without being overdone--the decor fits the urban space perfectly), has a fantastic shower, everything you need for a comfortable stay and is in one of my favorite Chicago neighborhoods, with a bajiggety restaurants, bars, shops, etc. The provided parking passes are super helpful, especially for weekend stays, because parking in this part of the city is no joke (in fact, if you can manage without a car, do, because you won't need it once you're here--everything is walkable, lyft/uber is plentiful and the El train is literally right there.)  If mobility is an issue for you, you should know that you have to walk up a flight of steep, narrow stairs to get to the apartment. Also, it's really in the real city, and real cities generally aren't that quiet, so if you're a super sensitive sleeper who needs deep, dark silence, you'll maybe want to bring ear plugs and/or a sleep mask.   But otherwise, I completely recommend this place. Jeremey is a kind, helpful and responsive host, the apartment is so lovely, and it's a really great value for Chicago, too.",1.0
Chicago,"We enjoyed our stay at Jeremy’s place. It's conveniently located, about 15 minutes to the loop and 20 minutes to Midway airport. Although we got around with Uber, the blue line is just minutes across the street. The apartment is super clean and lovely decorated. Jeremy is very thoughtful with the travel guide and tips. It was great to meet a Cal alumni at Chicago. =) I would recommend this listing to everyone.",1.0
Chicago,"This home was great. Jeremey provided easy check in details and instructions. The location was great because I was close to everything downtown and many shops and stores. I recommend this home and would certainly stay here again. Thanks again, Jeremey!",1.0
Chicago,"Jeremy was easily accessible for any questions via text and he even checked in the second day to make sure everything was okay. The apartment spacious, comfortable and centrally located. Just a few steps to the blue line CTA train, restaurants and shops. The neighborhood is busy so the provided parking permits were a huge plus.",1.0
Chicago,"This space is amazing. Plenty of room, furnishings are great, kitchen has everything you could need, and the shower was perfect after a long day of exploring Chicago in the cold. Jeremey was prompt with responses and great about giving me tips on places to check out. Literally just a few steps away from the Blue Line which made getting around the city super easy. I will definitely be looking to get this place again next time I am in Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"Great place! We stayed there with our 18month during our summer holiday trip, all three of us loved Jeremey’s place. Bigger than expected. Jeremey was very supportive and fast with all kind of questions. We can highly recommend this place, also when you are traveling with small children.",1.0
Chicago,"What a great stay in Chicago!!! Jeremey‘s loft is perfectly situated in one of our favourite areas within Chicago. There are so many things to explore in walking distance: restaurants, shopping, parks, and the great 606 trail. The train („L“, blue line) - which is more or less directly in front of the apartment - connects you directly with downtown as well as with the airport. The apartment is so cool, we would love to live there! Despite the busy street in front of the house the apartments inside is so quiet and we slept like babies. Jeremey is a fantastic host and helped us a lot to find our ways, gave us great recommendations and answered immediately whenever we wrote a message. We will definitely come again!!!",1.0
Chicago,"A very spacious and spotlessly clean apartment, it holds special charm with bare brick walls and wooden floors with plenty of seating and a very large bed with a well equipped dressing room.  The bathroom is great with a very impressive bath for easing away the muscles after a long day of exploring.  We didn’t use the kitchen much apart from making a hot drink as we ate out most of the time but there is a great health food shop just opposite and a food shop just by the subway station.  Although we didn’t get to meet Jeremey his communication with us was superb.",1.0
Chicago,"Jeremy’s place is amazing, not only is it huge, it has everything you need for a comfortable stay, it’s in a great location for getting around town (literally one minute walk from the blue line at Division), and really easy to get to on the blue line from O’hare airport.  Jeremy was a fantastic host, very quick to respond to any queries we had, and was kind enough to let us leave our bags for a couple of hours while we went for brunch before heading back to the airport.  I would highly recommend his apartment to anyone wanting to explore Chicago.",1.0

Chicago,"Jeremey’s place is so beautiful, a perfect loft you could imagine with a view to a quiet street. It has lots of light, in the morning or in the evening too. Subway is 1 minute walking distance (literally)! Fire station in the adjacent building is not bothering at all, they turned out to be the most quiet neighbors we ever had :) Many thanks to Jeremey, we would like to return!",1.0

Chicago,"Rob’s place was beautiful! It looked exactly as advertised. The apartment was spacious & stylishly decorated. Lots of restaurants & bars within walking distance, as well as a grocery store. Rob was super responsive & hospitable. We were not able to check in before 3, but he allowed us to leave our luggage in his store prior to check in & even took it upstairs to the apartment for us! The only downside was that the bedroom can get a little warm, especially on a hot summer day. Other than that, we fully enjoyed our stay. Would definitely stay here again!",1.0
Chicago,"Rob’s Place was beautifully furnished and decorated. It was also only a 3 minute walk from the nearest bus stop which can take you to downtown or any of the metro/L lines - very convenient. The only downside is that there is no air conditioning in the bedroom so it got really hot. It is also on the 3rd floor so that’s something to consider if you don’t like taking the stairs. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and would recommend it!",1.0
Chicago,Rob's place is immaculate! I have never seen an Airbnb so tastefully decorated and cozy. Its in the middle of a bustling restaurant and shopping district but is surprisingly quiet. Rob himself was very responsive and a great host. I would definitely come back here for sure. Make sure you take advantage of the $20/day parking that Rob offers. It was a lifesaver.,1.0
Chicago,"My experience could not have been better. This was the mog immaculate, stylish, modern, and comfortable AirBnB experience I've ever had. The owner has spared no expense, from stainless steel alliances to remodeled bathrooms and showers, to new wood flooring. The temper-pedic bed was heavenly, and the furnishings were modern and comfortable. The attention to detail was unparalleled, from train maps and restaurant guides to Chicago artwork and plenty of cooking utensils and supplies, as well as beauty and hygiene products. I was beyond impressed with the level of care and consideration.   When I return to Chicago in the future, this will be my first choice. Always.",1.0
Chicago,We were In Chicago to see Hamilton and sightsee with our teenaged daughter. We loved this location and neighborhood. It felt safe and there were tons of nearby places to eat or get groceries. The condo itself was extremely clean and was well stocked with necessities. It was spacious and we never felt crowded. Rob was a great host and was very responsive to our questions. It was a plus to have  parking available as we never moved our car until we left Chicago. I would definitely rent from Rob again,1.0
Chicago,"Rob's place is incredibly stylish, supremely located, and overall provides a comfortable, beautiful perch from which to explore the city of Chicago.  As a host, Rob was incredibly hospitable and communicative, and was very helpful in getting me situated for the stay.  I highly recommend the apartment and would definitely stay here again!",1.0
Chicago,"This place is a fantastic stay!  Everything is wonderfully decorated, well thought-out, very clean, and it has an authenticity you can only find in a beautiful historic building.  The location is great as well. It’s a 13 minute drive to downtown Chicago, and 500 feet from the best breakfast place in town “Whisk”. You must go there!  Only thing missing in the Airbnb was coffee, so you may want to bring your own. But they have multiple ways to make it if you do.  Great stay, highly recommend this Airbnb!",1.0
Chicago,My wife and I came in to Chicago for our wedding anniversary and are so glad we chose to stay with Rob.  Probably the best Airbnb experience we’ve had.  He really thinks of everything and we can’t recommend staying here enough.,1.0
Chicago,Rob’ s space is 5 stars & beyond.

Chicago,"By far-this Rob's place is the most STUNNING home my husband and I stayed in. The décor is stylish, modern and pure class. The Holiday decorations made it festive and cozy. I really want those flocked trees!! LOL Absolutely gorgeous. The pictures of this listing does it NO JUSTICE!! Rob is a delight and one of thee most gracious hosts I have encountered. His level of hospitality is unparalleled and he gave us some great suggestions of local eateries in the area. His home is in great proximity to downtown and other neighborhoods. We truly could not be more pleased and dreaded leaving to return back to our home state. However, we will certainly be back and definitely in the process of making plans to book Rob's home again. You will not be disappointed!! Truly his home is a GEM!!!",1.0
Chicago,"The warmest home we've ever been in. Sparkling clean, modern and superb interior design, great location and a very lovely, warm host. Thank you, Rob and we promise to only stay at your place whenever we're in Chicago! An experience to remember!",1.0
Chicago,"This was the cleanest Airbnb we’ve ever stayed in. If you are picky with finding a clean place that actually FEELS clean, this home is for you. You can immediately tell that Rob takes pride in his apartment and everything is so well maintained and stylishly decorated. The bed was a welcomed place for rest after a long day, and we loved how firm the mattress was and how fluffy the pillows were—very comfortable.  The amenities were spot on, the coffeemaker, the gas stove, plenty of dishes and quality cookware to use for making a meal. Not mention, the exceptional decor of the entire apartment! The location was excellent and walkable to numerous local restaurants and bars (a few were literally steps from the apartment door). We loved being on the third floor and always felt super safe. There is some traffic noise that can be heard in the bedroom, but Rob provides earplugs for light sleepers. In truth, we actually enjoyed being lulled to sleep by the sounds of the city and it didn’t bother us at all. The convenience of the grocery store being a 5 minute walk away made buying some pantry and fridge essentials easy. The couch in the living room was super comfy and perfect for relaxing and watching the Thanksgiving Day parade and some Netflix Christmas movies. This was the perfect Airbnb and we were highly impressed (not always easy). 5 stars to Rob for such an amazingly clean, comfortable, stylish, and well thought out home away from home. We’ll be back soon!",1.0
Chicago,"This place is so much nicer in person! And wow the bed was so comfortable we ended up sleeping the first night we got there instead of going out because we got trapped in the bed lol. Communicating with Rob was very easy and his home was supplied with everything!! First aid kit, make up remover wipes you name it lol. The home is in a very quiet and safe neighborhood. Would definitely stay again, one of the nicest places I have ever stayed!",1.0
Chicago,"We had a short but wonderful stay at Rob's place for a weekend trip to Chicago. Communication and check-in were quick and easy, and it was a breeze to get there from the airport on the train and a bus.  The space was spotlessly clean and beautifully furnished, with thoughtful touches that made our stay really comfortable. The location is great too, with a grocery store nearby and lots of good food/drink options as well.  Our only regrets are that we didn't stay here longer to enjoy it more and that we had to catch a Sunday morning flight before we could peruse the beautiful store downstairs some more. We would definitely stay here again, and will happily recommend it to any family and friends who may be looking for a place to stay in Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"Rob’s apartment was exactly what we need for a wonderful stay in Chicago. It was styled beautifully and Rob provided everything we could possibly need- thought of everything! Only note to future guests is that it is on the third floor, so keep this mind when packing large luggage. I would highly recommend Rob and his apartment!",1.0
Chicago,"Rob’s place is one of the nicest, best located, and real value of all the places we have stayed!  It is tastefully furnished, very clean, modern, and had everything we needed to feel at home, including a fully-equipped kitchen.  Conveniently located to all the sites we wanted to see.  Also, close to a supermarket which was handy, and few steps to dozens of restaurants and cafes.  Rob was always quick to respond to my questions.  We highly recommend this wonderful apartment!  Looking forward to staying here next time we visit Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"The best place I’ve ever stayed at! Decorated to the 9s, home included everything I never even thought of - including band aids and bath salts for a lovely soak!

I will most certainly stay here again.",1.0
Chicago,"This might be my favorite Airbnb stay to date. The apartment so stunning, clean, and comfortable and charming Ukrainian Village with so much to offer, we chose to make fewer trips into the heart of the city to spend more time enjoying and exploring the immediate surroundings both in and out of the apartment. Yoga, restaurants, shops, grocery...everything within walking distance and this little oasis to temporarily call home. Rob couldn’t have been a better host. Will be back for sure!",1.0
Chicago,Rob’s place was amazing. Right in the center of everything. The location was close to many restaurants and bars. It is also a short ride to surrounding neighborhoods and downtown. The place itself was amazing with all the amenities needed for a great stay. Rob was prompt in his communication and was right below if needed. The parking space was a bonus as it is hard to find parking in this neighborhood without a permit.,1.0
Chicago,"Location, atmosphere, beautiful decor, every thought to amenities (even a First Aid Kit!)... you simply can't go wrong with this great condo in Ukrainian Village.  It was a snowy weekend so we especially enjoyed the cabinet full of games!  We were visiting family in Streeterville and getting there was no problem at all.  Rob greeted us when I arrived, and check-out was very simple.  Also, my brother drove over from a neighboring city to meet me, so we appreciated the off-street parking for him and his daughter.  Stay with Rob!  You won't regret it.",1.0
Chicago,"This is a stylish, modern yet comfortable apartment located in a cool part of town with lots of options to dine and a young at heart hip vibe.  I felt like a movie star in the surroundings & was happy to find out that the amazing shop below actually sold some of the items that are featured in the living space. It is located on an active street on the 3rd floor of a recently enovated building.  Rob is extremely responsive and a caring host.  I look forward to staying there again!",1.0

Very clean and in a great location. 10/10 would recommend!",1.0
Chicago,"This was our first AirBNB and I gave 5 stars all the way through. Chris was an amazing host. Quick responses and clear communication. Super helpful with us as we learned to navigate city, food and parking. Being from a rural area, we were grateful to have the help! Maps on fridge. Nice residential area, felt safe even at night. Extremely clean. Special touches such as video games and snacks. Went above and beyond to provide a welcoming and safe environment. Room was stylized, modern. Plenty of amenities, even access to laundry. If we make our way back to town, we’ll stay here again. Thank you for making our first AirBNB memorable!",1.0
Chicago,"Great place to stay! Very clean and convenient to food and shops! Reminded me of being Ina little apartment. The shower was a bit small, so if you're a larger person it may be difficult to fit. But it was a very nice place and the host were quick to respond.",1.0

The decor is fantastic and we loved many of the little touches including the board games, tasteful art, game systems, and the water and drinks in the fridge were a welcome surprise after our evening arrival. Having central heat as well as a space heater in the unit helped make sure we stayed nice and toasty during our visit. We didn't take advantage of them, but the fact that a washer and dryer were available was a nice bonus.   We'll definitely look here first on our next trip to Chicago!",1.0

Chicago,"What a gem! Christopher’s place was exactly as described including a ton of extras. Christopher was quick to respond before and during my stay. He left a light on for me the night I arrived since I had a super late flight. He even checked in on me the next day to make sure I had everything I needed. The place was totally spotless. The bed was very comfy and there were tons of extra pillows. The kitchen was fully equipped and he even stocked it with several quick food items. These were much appreciated especially the first morning. The space felt so much more roomy than I was expecting. Ceilings are a bit lower being a garden unit but I had no problem at all with it. The water pressure in the shower was really great. Christopher made a really detailed welcome guide with lots of great info abt the neighborhood. The studio is only 3 short blocks away from a bus that takes you directly to the belmont el station (abt a 20-30 min ride). I felt very safe in the neighborhood (family vibe) even when coming in using transit late at night by myself. If you are wanting to do a lot of things in the Loop, transit took me 45-hour sometimes depending on the time of day. This was not a big deal for me bc I wanted a neighborhood experience vs more of a downtown touristy one, but it did take longer to get to and from. Lastly, Christopher was kind enough to  hold my luggage for me on my last day since I had a later flight. All in all, fantastic experience and I highly recommend this listing. Thank you so much, Christopher!",1.0

Chicago,Chris was an amazing host.  His place was very clean and better than we expected.  This was the wife’s first time visiting Chicago and she wasn’t disappointed as this place offers a lot of space for two guests.  Parking on the same street was hit and miss but that can be expected for a big city.  We took Lyft anytime we were visiting downtown Chicago.  It was nice to come and go as we pleased.

Chicago,"Look no further for your Air B&B, this place will down right spoil you. Comfortable and safe location, complete privacy and autonomy, not to mention all the helpful ways Christopher makes your stay easier. There were snacks, towels, soap, just everything you'd need. The bed was incredibly comfortable and clean. It was truly a wonderful visit. ",1.0
Chicago,"Christopher and Pawel are fantastic hosts. They were super considerate before and during our stay. Their space is comfortable, clean, and thoughtfully laid out. From the time we booked to when we checked out, Christopher was communicative and extremely helpful.

Chicago,"Chris' place is really lovely! Plenty of space for 2 people, with lots of thoughtful touches like biscuits, bottled water, tea and coffee etc! The kitchen was well equipped to make meals, and Chris quickly provided a can opener when we asked to borrow one. The washer and dryer in the apartment were also very handy. Good location in a residential neighbourhood, about 10-15 min walk to the local Aldi and 10 mins to shops, including the currency exchange to get bus tickets. 5 mins walk from the bus stop that takes you to the blue line, which then takes you to O'hare airport or downtown. It takes around an hour to get to the Museum campus, and about 45 mins to attractions like the Skydeck and Hancock Tower. Chris recommended an architecture boat tour which was fab. Communication was always fast and helpful, would definitely recommend!",1.0

Chicago,"Samantha’s place was perfect for our short stay! It was very clean, stylish and cozy. The small, secluded patio was a sweet surprise. Only things to note- the stairs are very steep and the neighbors have a puppy, which was loud when we came in after a concert during quiet hours. Check in instructions were thorough and easy! We would love to stay again.",1.0

We slept comfortably and were within walking distance to a lot of restaurants, bars, and the concert venue we attended. We had a great time and would love to stay there again.",1.0
Chicago,"Samantha’s place is modern cute chic. Every piece of furniture is well thought out with aesthetic and function in mind. The steps to the loft bedroom: first, it’s very roomy up there and cozy. The steps itself could be problematic for people who are afraid of heights but for someone like me who is uncoordinated, it was surprisingly easy to navigate. Although, I didn’t need anything, Samantha made me feel like she was only an email/text/phone call away if I needed assistance or info. Also, there’s a small but very cute balcony where u can enjoy your morning coffee.",1.0
Chicago,Fun spot to serve as base camp to explore Chicago as you can reach a bunch of fun neighborhoods inside of 30 min. The unit itself was extremely clean and Samantha was super responsive. The lock box makes check in and out simple. Added touches like the full kitchen and French press are a bonus. ,1.0
Chicago,"I had a great stay at Samantha's. The space was lovely and very clean. I didnt spend much time here because I like to explore when I visit a new place, but I appreciated the relaxing and simple vibe of the space at the end of a long day. Samantha and I communicated via text and I found her to be very kind and accommodating regarding a specific inquiry that I had. If you're looking and this place is free, book it now!",1.0
Chicago,"Samantha's place was the perfect place to explore logan square, we used to live in the city and hadn't done much exploring there.

We got awesome suggestions on places to eat and drink and it doesn't take too long to get into the city. 10/10 would recommend!!",1.0
Chicago,"Samantha & Jonathan's loft was exactly as pictured, and located in a convenient location. I loved the apartment - I would love to live here myself! The stairs to the loft was quite steep as others describe, and I left my suitcase downstairs and only went upstairs to sleep. The bed was very comfortable. My friend whom I stayed with wanted an easy access to the bathroom during night, so she decided to use the air mattress downstairs, which we found in the closet (we moved furnitures around to make space). The walk to the California CTA station was 15-20 min for me, but since it was quite a cold week, I often opted for Uber. As we had packed plans in downtown, we did not get to explore much of the neighborhood nor get to ask for neighborhood tips that Samantha was happy to share, but I'd love to come back to this loft and explore more!",1.0
Chicago,"The loft is located in a great quiet spot that is walking distance from great restaurants and bars. It was a ~15 minute walk from both the Logan Square and California blue line stops, and extremely close to tons and tons of good restaurants and bars (check out Lula, Giant, and Longman & Eagle). Samantha was a great host and the place was spotless when we arrived, with tea and some nice snacks sitting on the table. Checking in and out was as easy and quick as it gets, and we appreciated Samantha periodically messaging us to check on our experience. We would stay here again in a heartbeat. Our only warning is that all the stairs in the building are extremely steep and narrow. We didn't have any problems, but you should be careful. Overall a 5/5 experience.",1.0
Chicago,"The space is exactly as pictured.  Simple, basic, perfect for one or two people.  The bed in the loft was comfortable and the HDTV had plenty of premium channels.  The neighborhood is quiet and we felt safe.  Parking on the street wasn't an issue for us, but it did seem to be full in the evening.  Major bus line is 3 blocks away that will take you straight to the northside Fullerton train stops and the Blue Line station that goes to the loop is about 8 blocks away.  The host is easily reached and communication was great.  Thanks!",1.0
Chicago,"I enjoyed my stay in this space! The studio itself was very clean and quiet during sleeping hours. The staircase to the bed was a little steeper than I had expected, but it was sturdy and I got used to it. It was in a lovely location that had access to buses and trains. I did do a bit of walking, but that was my choice. Samantha and Jonathan were quick with communication and gave suggestions for the area. I would stay again. Thanks!",1.0

We would definitely stay here again. Thank you!",1.0
Chicago,"Samantha's place is absolutely marvelous! It's located in a nice residential area, with some fun bars and restaurants in the neighborhood. If you don't want to wait for a bus, it's a bit of a walk to the blue line, but nothing bad. Uber rides into the city were not that expensive and an easy way to get into the city. The apartment itself is really, really nice. Clean, spacious and an extremely comfy bed. I would highly recommend it to anybody!",1.0
Chicago,A very stylish flat with lots of complimentary toiletries and helpful guide books for the area. The flat isn’t in the city centre but taking an Uber carpool is a cheap and easy way of getting into the main part.,1.0
Chicago,This is a beautifully-designed loft apartment in an upmarket part of town.  It is sparkling clean and has some nice touches such as local coffee. Communication with Samantha was very smooth and she answered our questions quickly.  I would highly recommend staying here in Chicago.,1.0
Chicago,"Lovely apartment in a great area of the city.  Local amenities were perfect (I'd recommend Tony's for any grocery requirement and Wyler Road for a chilled drink and a bit to eat!) and not too far from the ""L"" to the Loop where it's a 20 min ride in.   Hosts were great and very responsive to any request and requirement we had and helped out as much as possible.  The stairs up to the mezzanine are definitely steep but we expected this from the description so not a problem at all and the apartment is carefully thought out to give maximum usability of the space.  Overall a fantastic expperience of this amazing city.",1.0
Chicago,"Place was amazing! My boyfriend and I absolutely loved our stay here in this loft. Area is very clean and very stylish. All of our questions were answered very fast and accurately. Everything was supplied for us, they even had Q-tips lol. ",1.0
Chicago,"We had an amazing stay at Samantha's place. It is located in a quiet neighborhood within 20min walking distance from the blue line. The apartment is spacious and has everything you need including cooking facilities, big comfortable bed, tv etc. We were a bit delayed and arrived late in the evening, but Samantha was extremely kind by helping us ordering pizza while we were absolutely wrecked from traveling. Furthermore, she always responded very quickly to questions from us. We ran in to her husband Jonathan a couple of times who was also super friendly and gave us a ton of advice on what to do in the city. Overall we had a great couple of days in Chicago and we definitely recommend this place! ",1.0
Chicago,"Samantha's place was perfect for our weekend getaway. Travel around the city was very convenient with transit and biking options very closeby. The space was extremely tidy and comfortable, and our hosts were very accommodating...thanks for a wonderful Chicago experience!",1.0
Chicago,"This apartment is great! The apartment itself is already beautiful and special with its high ceilings, and the location is also very nice. In walking distance from Logan square, with nice coffee bars, restaurants, shops and street art. But also in walking distance from public transport that takes you to downtown in just a few stops. We would definitely recommend this place for a great visit to this great city",1.0
Chicago,"Lovely loft studio, spotlessly clean and very well designed with everything we needed. Location is good with the metro about 15 mins walk away then 20 mins to downtown, and a Chicago bike scheme station 5mins away and an even quicker cycle to downtown. We also enjoyed the 606 trail, Chicago's answer to the Highline which is also close by.  So a great place and a great location.",1.0
Chicago,Beautiful apartment in quite neighborhood. The space is great it's location relative to public transit is awesome. Samantha was quick to respond to any questions. I will definitely be checking availability next time I'm back in Chicago.,1.0
Chicago,"We had a great stay at Logan Square. The appartment was spacious (more so than we expected) and very clean with thoughtful provisions provided.   Samantha and Jonathon provided us with a great list of nearby places do eat and drink (from fresh coffee to pizza) and were very helpful in communicating when we asked for help.   Logan Sqaure itself is a lovely leafy neighbourhood around half an hr from Downtown on the train. There's plenty of amenities a short walk from the appartment, as well as loads of great bars. A taxi into Downtown is quicker but more expensive.   The 'L' (elevated train) is a 15-20 min walk from the appt and then a further 15 min or so ride into downtown where there is plenty to do. A weekly ticket for the train is around $30 and gives you access to trains and buses. Very handy for getting around as the bus and L system is easy to use.  On a clear day, we would recommend hiring a bike and taking the Lake Shore route which runs alongside Lake Michigan. You get stunning views of the iconic skyscrapers from across the water.  Hancock Tower on a clear day is also a must see too, with great views for miles.  If the weather is cooler, then there are loads of great museums to visit. the History of Chicago by Lincoln Park is great. The Old Town is nearby for a drink afterwards too.  Definitely a great city to visit with lots to do, and a great appartment in a great neighbourhood. 10/10  Thanks",1.0
Chicago,"The apartment was lovely, clean, and the coffee/snacks were appreciated. The security within the apartment was great, and although the surrounding area was less confidence-inspiring, she had us send a photo of our car once we arrived, and the area had cameras, so it put me at ease. We were super close to both bus and train options that we utilized several times, and within walking distance of target for quick pick-ups. We enjoyed our stay!",1.0
Chicago,"Kay is the best superhost you will ever have!! She is great with communication and is very welcoming! Her apartment has a home-like feeling that will make your vacation even better. Cleanest place ever!! Absolutely spotless and smells amazing!!  If you are looking for suggestions of where to eat and shop, Kay will give you a list of her favorite places and provides a variety brochures, pamphlets, flyers, and food menu’s! I had mentioned my family was vegan and she gave me options of food choices around the area!  Great location!!! I highly recommend staying at Kay’s place if you are visiting Chicago!!",1.0
Chicago,"Kay’s place was very cute and clean!! She was super quick to respond to anything. The train is a quick walk from the apartment though I don’t think I would personally feel safe walking from the train tooo late at night as a young lady. Loved how she  had treats available like bananas, it’s, orange juice, coffee. It is very convenient for a quick trip to downtown Chicago!",1.0
Chicago,"Even though Kay's place was more on the south side of Chicago and I was going to the north side for a Cubs game, her place was great for a one-night stay with how reasonably priced it was right before Memorial Day weekend. I just got ubers to get to and from the game rather than public transit. Kay's place was very comfortable and she was a great host!",1.0
Chicago,"Kay’s place was amazing! Such thoughtful, kind touches, and Kay is super communicative. Seriously, this room was nicer and more well-equipped than some of the luxury hotel’s I’ve stayed at. 100% would stay here again!",1.0
Chicago,"From the extreme cleanliness of the apartment to the added extras everywhere you turn, this place was absolutely perfect! The host is respectful and generous with the most friendly senior kitty ever! Coming “home” to a snuggly feline in the living room was probably the best thing ever (I’m an extreme cat person). However, if you’re not into cats, no worries; the cat isn’t pushy and you could probably spend your entire trip ~not~ seeing him if that’s more your style. The off-street parking was clean and safe, something that can be hard to secure in Chicago. The apartment is located very close to both the train and the bus, making in-city traveling quite easy. I would highly recommend this AirBnB!",1.0
Chicago,It’s a wonderful and comfortable place to stay. Kay is really great at communicating with guests and is super nice and welcoming. The space is very clean and has a nice charm to it. We only stayed for one night but I definitely will keep this place in mind if I ever make it up to Chicago again.,1.0
Chicago,I extremely enjoyed my stay at Kay's place.  The location is perfect. My favorite part was having a Target with a Starbucks and market near by. This place is also closely located to a CTA and the freeway entrance if you have a car.  Kay provides many good ameneties and I was very happy for that. She is quickly responsive and super helpful. I'm glad I got to meet her. She is a sweet person.  It is 15 min away from the city.    Also if you have a rental/car there is parking near by!!!  Thanks Kay,1.0
Chicago,"Five stars isn’t enough! Kay made me feel very welcome and comfortable. I felt as if I was staying with family or an old friend, definitely not a stranger. She provided breakfast and coffee for me before I headed out and it definitely gave me a great start. I have a cat at my place, so their friendly lil guy made me feel even more at home. I would definitely recommend her to anyone else and will definitely stay with her again if the opportunity arises.",1.0
Chicago,"I was pleasantly surprised by how amazing the experience turned out to be at Kay's home. The entire house felt inviting and immediately puts you at ease. She puts the guest first and it shows in her thoughtful approach to outfitting the room. From soft bath towels and a loofah at your bedside, to the coffee and tea bar in the kitchen for hot drinks in the morning. She really wants you to feel like you are taken care of the moment you walk in the door. The location is convenient with good selection of restaurants in the area to choose from and downtown is a hop and a skip away for those who want to take in the sights. If it isn't obvious already,  I highly recommend staying with Kay during your trip to Chicago!",1.0
Chicago,"I stayed at Kay's place with two of my friends over St. Pat's weekend. The free parking was a huge blessing, and the apartment was very close to the CTA for local travel. The apartment itself was clean and well-kept. Kay was a wonderful host!

Also, there were loads of local brochures and magazines to browse. Her 16 year old cat Toby is such a love! He was super friendly and sweet. It was raining on the day I was going out to adventure in the city and I Kay was so cool about lending me her umbrella. She’s a kind soul and was so helpful with local tips for eats and getting around. Highly recommend staying at Kay’s!",1.0
Chicago,"Kay provided a great Airbnb!

Chicago,Kay is an Amazing host with an air bnb that makes you feel at home! The entire house is sparkling clean and full of creative and cute decor.

This is the second time I’ve stayed here and both times there were other guests yet it was very quiet and comfortable stay and rest. Respect this space as it truly is a gem!,1.0
Chicago,Great stay. Kay’s place was in a great location close to downtown and public transportation. The room and bathroom were very clean and had nice touches.

The apartment and room were cozy and I felt like being at home during my stay, with access to kitchen and living room area. The cat is super friendly too!   Kay as a person was a nice host. She even gave me some medicine upon request, as I was catching some cold from the weather in Chicago.   If I ever come back to Chicago I have a reliable place to stay :)",1.0
Chicago,"Kay is an absolute pro of a host.  She communicated check-in instructions very clearly and regularly  touched-base to make sure I had everything I needed during my stay.  Her place is ideally situated a mere 5 minute walk from an L train station (which is a fantastic way to get around Chicago as I discovered).  Very comfortable, clean, and safe place to spend your nights when visiting Chicago-- can't recommend enough.",1.0
Chicago,"The misfortune of staying at Kay's is that one will quickly realize that not every host will be like her! :-/ I was able to take the train (as she pre-stay suggested) directly out of midway and walk about 2 blocks & if cleanliness is next to godliness, then trust Kay has you covered. And to be completely honest, Kay extended herself to me in an act that goes way beyond the scope of AirBnb. I was comfortable, I felt safe, the room was very dedicated. Being that she was my 1st AirBnb experience,  I really feel like I lucked up. Omg, and her snack bar (fresh yummies), were too delish! :-* #BookHer",1.0
Chicago,"Kay is a fantastic host and I can not recommend her enough. When we contacted her for anything we needed, the response was lightning-fast!

If you’re looking for a great experience for a really reasonable price, definitely book with Kay!",1.0
Chicago,"If I could give 6 stars I would. Kay's place was immaculate, cute, comfortable, easy to access — everything you could ask for in an Airbnb. Kay herself is an excellent and hospitable host, helping us out with umbrellas, breakfast, sunscreen, loofas — all the little things that shows she truly cares about making her guests' experience as amazing as possible. She is a gracious and generous person and I would 100% stay at her property again. ",1.0
Chicago,"If you don't like stairs or cats, that is the only reason not to stay here. Location is good, ample parking & light outdoors- ammenities are top & Kay is an awesome host with a BIG heart for her aging cat- that alone should make her 1st choice for any cat lover.",1.0
Chicago,Kay's place was absolutely amazing. She was a perfect host and made my vacation feel so comfortable. I was traveling alone and one late night she even messaged me to make sure I was ok.

Chicago,This was a truly desperate search for a safe place for my daughter to stay last minute while out of town.  She made last minute plans to travel to Chicago for the Gold Cup soccer match.  Once there she could not find a hotel to rent to her because she is 18.  She was in her car crying.  I booked with Jim on the internet and spoke with him by phone.  He was so great!!!  He met her and her boyfriend at the door.  He even spoke Spanish with her boyfriend which made him feel great.  He assured me by phone about how safe the neighborhood  was and that he would be on the premises just a moments notice away.  He treated them like adults but still helped me feel comfortable about their safety knowing they will always be my babies.  It was truly above and beyond.  And my daughter said the apartment was gorgeous.,1.0

Took a few baths, nice bathroom. It was very quiet, almost no street noise. Just a few blocks from Clark street and a few more to the train. We loved staying here!",1.0
Chicago,"We had such an amazing experience. The hospitality, special touches, neighborhood and proximity to downtown Chicago were perfect.  It felt like we were special guests our hosts were trying to impress!  I hope to stay here again.",1.0
Chicago,Great experience at Jim and Maximo's. Easy to find location in a very cool neighborhood of Chicago with plenty of shops and restaurants. Stylish interior and very clean. Initially we were missing a bath towel but the hosts were very quick to correct this mistake. We'd definitely come back to stay again.,1.0
Chicago,"The apartment is as beautiful as the photos, comfortable, and quiet. It’s the perfect spot for a weekend trip (or longer). Our hosts thought of everything and checked in with suggestions and to ask if there was anything we needed. I definitely hope to return!",1.0
Chicago,This apartment is a very stylish and super comfortable place.  It is on a quiet street on the edge of the popular Andersonville neighborhood.  There are plenty of restaurants and bars which you can easily walk to along with some boutique shopping.   You are a quick walk to several CTA bus routes and a longer walk to the red line.   Maximo was there when I checked in and I had a couple of questions during my week stay and they very promptly answered.   I would definitely recommend and stay in this location again.,1.0
Chicago,"Jim's place was wonderful and exceeded expectations for a stay in Andersonville. There were all the amenities and the apartment was quiet, spacious, and very accessible.

Chicago,"This place was spacious, clean, and thoughtfully decorated. We used the Keurig to make coffee every morning and Jim and Maximo were great about checking in to see if we needed anything.

Chicago,"Jim & Maximo’s apartment is beautiful & well located. This was our 3rd visit to Chicago for a girls weekend; first time in Andersonville. Nice quiet neighborhood with Uber/lyft convenience to most city locations in 15-20 min. Apartment is on ground floor, some street noise but overall very quiet. Neighborhood is safe with quick walks to great eating spots. We recommend the little red wolf & mhenry.  Apartment is well furnished with nice appliances & conveniences, great WiFi. Host was attentive, but only needed on day 1: we’re pretty low key. Only recommendation would be additional blankets/ linens for pull out couch in living area.",1.0
Chicago,"From the moment I booked, everything was five stars. I never waited on a reply. I was behind schedule on check in day, nevertheless, Maximo promptly greeted me and I checked in immediately. The place was spotless and it was better than advertised. The nieghborhood was quaint and there was always parking available. I would stay here again and highly recommend it to friends, family, and anyone visiting looking for a clean, updated condo in an awesome Chicago nieghborhood.",1.0
Chicago,"Had a great stay, I️ checked in sooner and they gave me no problem, I️ was greeted as soon as I️ got there and given a welcome and was told they were staying in the same building so I️f I️ needed anything to ask, also gave me background on the neighborhood. The apt is so clean, very stylish and cozy. And the neighborhood is super safe with free parking!! The hosts were friendly and attentive to us. We really enjoyed our stay.",1.0

Such an amazingly diverse, safe clean and welcoming neighborhood! the apartment was beautiful and absolutely spotless I've never seen anything so clean! Jim was amazing! I could not have asked for a better experience!",1.0
Chicago,"Our stay in Chicago was great and we really enjoyed staying in Andersonville. It was far enough away to be quiet but only a 12-15 minute walk to the train station, which we didn’t mind at all. The neighborhood felt safe enough to walk in and we liked the local coffee shops and restaurants.   The apartment was nicely decorated and clean. I would just give a heads up that if you’re a light sleeper you can hear the hosts upstairs because it’s an old building. I would never take away a star for this because it’s just a personal thing. My wife is a heavy sleeper and it never bothered her but I had to download a white noise app on my phone to fall asleep.   The hosts were great communicators and asked if we needed anything and how our stay was going. We both enjoyed it and would stay here again!",1.0
Chicago,"Jim's place is just as pictured and described and was a lovely, comfortable, clean and quiet place to stay while I visited family and friends in the Chicago area. The location is halfway between the main city and Evanston, which was perfect for me, and it was very close to some really cool restaurants/bakeries, etc. Had no trouble getting around and found parking on the street each night without trouble. Safe and quiet neighborhood. Jim and Maximo were very attentive and had supplied everything I needed for my stay. Would definitely stay there again.",1.0
Chicago,This place is as advertised or better. Superhosts and great amenities. Secure neighborhood and a beautiful apartment make this a great place to stay when you’re in Chicago.

Chicago,"Jim's place was FANTASTIC. The place was exactly what we expected it to be from the fabulous photos which were 100% accurate showing off the truly lovely and well decorated apartment. Very clean, well appointed, extra towels and pillows, fantastic magazines for relaxing reading, GREAT map of the local neighborhood in order to find fantastic local shops and places to eat.  You can totally get around on public transit (mostly CTA Bus) from this apartment. Note: the place is a little far from the CTA train stations into downtown. We rented a car and really appreciated the flexibility to get around the city easily and great neighborhood street parking.   The apartment is well appointed with everything you need for your stay. One of the bedrooms is street facing but there is not much traffic so it stayed very quiet at night. Air conditioning for the summer time is a huge plus on muggy hot days!  Andersonville neighborhood is one of my favorite areas of Chicago. It is quaint, full of local  charm, great eats and drinks within walking distance, and a fantastic way to get a feel of what real Chicago is like (and not the fake touristy stuff). Off the beaten path geek thing we did - we drove to and walked through the nearby Rosehill Cemetery Mausoleum. The old original section has a substantial collection of LC Tiffany stained glass windows and walking the completely silent hallways to see the sun shining through these beautiful windows is pretty awesome if you like that sort of thing.  Love Jim's place! Beyond 5 stars! We will hopefully be back to town and rent out his apartment again in the future. ",1.0
Chicago,"Great space to spend a few days. Neighborhood was a few miles north of the downtown area of Chicago. Very quiet but still had the Chicago city feel to it.

So you guys are very nice  and  your hospitality goes beyond  what words can describe .  I know  past experiences  that Airbnb have change my life on how I stay in a city or a place of my travels keep up the good work.  So your place very  amazing  it’s worth every penny that I spend.

Chicago,"The apartment was beautiful with 2 comfortable beds, with the bedrooms on opposite ends of the unit from each other.  A very short walk (few short blocks) from downtown Andersonville with all of it's shops and restaurants, with a farmers market every Wednesday. Beautiful area to walk around. I'd recommend it to anyone looking to stay in the area.",1.0
Chicago,"Jim and Maximo were great hosts! This spacious two-bed, one-bath is the perfect getaway for family and friends! I picked Andersonville, because it's a great LGBTQ+ friendly neighborhood and was a great location to experience all of the Pride festivities happening over the weekend during our stay. Jim and Maximo were super responsive and very accommodating throughout my entire experience even before arriving for the weekend! The neighborhood is a family-friendly area and was very walk-able with lots of places to go for food, coffee or to go grocery shopping. The apartment was very spacious, clean and had lots of cute touches/decorations to make the place feel like home. I will definitely look to stay here again in the future during my next visit to Chicago!",1.0

It was just as pictured, the location is awesome to the city we visited, both hosts handled any/all things we needed/checked up on us, and all of our necessities were met and beyond. This was a very pleasurable stay and I would definitely recommend this place to friends if they ever come visit Chicago.   You have everything you need within a short walk and if you really need to, there’s a Target .7 miles from the place. Close eating and bar spots within a short walk. It takes about 20-30 min to get into Chicago.   Awesome visit and great hosts.",1.0
Chicago,"Jim & Maximo we’re outstanding hosts. Every detail of this beautiful apartment was lovely. The location was great for our stay in north Chicago.

Chicago,"Loved Jim and Maximo’s place, it was very spacious, clean and stylish. I enjoyed looking through the magazines and the beds were extremely comfortable.

We would definitely stay again upon a return visit to Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"We really enjoyed staying at Jim's place over a quick weekend get-away to Chicago. It's very close to all the Andersonville shops and restaurants on Clark St. and a short walk to the el stop to go downtown; it's in a lovely, quiet, leafy neighborhood of brownstones. Parking was easy -- there was street parking right outside the apartment; we parked the car when we arrived Friday and didn't need to move it or use it until we left on Sunday. The apartment was very clean and well-appointed, with a great kitchen and nice amenities. Jim was there to give us the keys when we checked in; he and Maximo were available if needed but also gave us space. We'd highly recommend this one!",1.0
Chicago,"Stylish apartment in a great location with convenient parking and great restaurants/shops nearby. We really enjoyed our stay here. The kitchen had everything we needed to cook and prepare our own food. Jim was very responsive and accommodating, which made everything easy and enjoyable. I wish that we could have controlled the heat ourselves, but when the apartment started to get a bit chilly, we notified Jim, and he was able to turn on the heat for us quickly. Overall a great space and great experience!",1.0
Chicago,"Jim’s place is aesthetically pleasing, clean, and comfortable. It is in the lovely neighborhood of Andersonville and accessible to many restaurants and shops. I appreciated the clear communication, quick responses, ease of check in, and helpfulness when I needed to extend my stay. The house is well equipped with the conveniences and thoughtful touches that are helpful to a busy business traveler- a high quality iron and real ironing board, a washer and drier, toiletries, coffee etc.I would definitely stay at Jim’s place again.",1.0
Chicago,"We loved staying here! The place was beautiful, with many nice touches, a charming older building but remodelled with modern amenities, and sparkling clean. Getting in was very convenient, there were snacks left there for us to enjoy, parking on the street was easy, and Jim and Maximo always responded immediately to all of our queries, plus checked in to see if we wanted coffee, or needed anything else from them, checked on the comfort of the beds, and generally made sure that we had a great stay and felt well cared for. The kitchen is well appointed - the only thing not available was a microwave, but Maximo commented that he's about to get one for the apartment so that can be expected soon.  This is a great apartment with caring and involved hosts. I recommend staying here unconditionally!",1.0
Chicago,"The apartment was beautiful and very spacious. There are restaurants, grocery stores and pharmacies within walking distance. The neighborhood seemed very safe and we enjoyed walking around even in the cold weather. The Keurig and snack basket were nice touches which we appreciated. The beds were  too firm to be comfortable for me, but my boyfriend was fine with it, so it may be personal preference. Jim and Maximo were very attentive and always ready to help. Please note, the apartment does not have a microwave. Also, there is a policy that you cannot have any guest enter into the apartment (not just for sleeping, but for visiting too) which I misunderstood when booking, but it was not a problem since it was only the two of us. If you're traveling in a group or with family staying in other places, you may want to look for another place if you want them to be able to visit you. Overall our stay was lovely and we would recommend this apartment.",1.0
Chicago,"Location, location, location! The spot is located in a beautiful historic neighbourhood filled with lots of charm, great shops, and fantastic restaurants within walking distance.

Chicago,"Place was great! Clean, cozy, great location. Check in & out went seamlessly. LOVED the bathtub and shower. I would definitely recommend. The TV package was a surprising plus.. not usually one to hang out too much at a bnb- but after a day of drinking at Wrigley we were feeling a little rough-  it was so nice to just chill out the next day watching movies and ordering food! Loved it!",1.0
Chicago,"As a single traveler the studio set up was perfect for me. The location was great, since I had just been staying downtown at a conference prior to my stay it was nice to get out a bit and see some other neighborhoods. I could easily walk to the 606 Trail - which I really enjoyed - and N Milwaukee Ave for some fun shopping. I appreciated the guide they had in the studio with local recommendations listed, I got take-out from the Indian place down the street and it was delicious. Very comfortable bed!",1.0

It was the perfect size and had everything I needed. The style of the whole place was gorgeous. I can tell a lot of thought went into creating this space. The shower and bathtub were amazing, and it was very helpful that there was a hair dryer, shampoo/conditioner, body wash, etc. When I do get the chance to travel to Chicago again I hope this is available. I can’t say enough about how much I loved this place!",1.0

Chicago,"What can I say except that Elinor’s place was great! The little touches, such as welcome beers, pour over coffee, books on Chicago, and available toilet trees (we flew in and only had carry-one) were perfect.

The weather is Chicago sure is unpredictable and crazy, so make sure you have a jacket or umbrella on stand by! Haha Thank you again for allowing us to stay in your lovely place!",1.0

Chicago,"If I had more a sense of self-interest, I would write the  worst review ever so that this amazing space is always available for me when I'm in Chicago. First: it is it's own little building in the city. Wow! It's designed so beautifully, I took tons of photos to inspire my guest house back in CT. Elinor was responsive, accommodating, and super nice. I'm spreading the word to all of my friends who are jazzed staying there. The location is 10-12 minutes from downtown... well worth it for these gorgeous accommodations. BTW: the photos don't really capture the details and inviting sweetness of the place. I'll see you again, Elinor!",1.0
Chicago,"Ellie and Devin's space is charming! It's a well-designed, well-maintained large studio with incredibly thoughtful touches: books about the history of Chicago, more books from Chicago based writers and poets, games, postcards, and even stamps. I was a little nervous the first night with the studio being so close to the street, but I slept like a dream – the bed is comfortable and the studio is airy and bright. The place is exactly as pictured, even better. Ellie and Devin were very responsive and helpful. I would definitely come back and highly recommend staying here.",1.0

It’s so stylish, quaint, adorable neighborhood, and the little touches are unlimited! There was wine and beer stocked in the fridge, a cute pour over coffee pot and trader joe beans with a grinder! Basically I’m sad I can’t just move and stay in forever. People always say, “oh I’ll be back” but this is serious, I can’t wait to book again! I have best friends who live in the city and I’d still pay to stay in this awesome space! Airbnb MVP! Don’t hesitate! Book it now!",1.0

If you want a spot not in the downtown hustle but still in the city enough to Uber for good rates, look no further. Quiet neighborhood. Pictures described the space very accurately. It was the perfect space for a quick getaway to Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"Amazing and beautiful first airbnb experience. The place was decorated very modern and was clean. Both the walk in shower and claw-foot tub were great and the water got very hot.

There were also nice personal touches such as food recommendations and stocked beverages in the fridge (water filter, coffee, and some wine). Me and my boyfriend had an amazing time.",1.0
Chicago,"Wonderful place to stay while visiting the windy city of Chicago! Not far from great restaurant, bars, shopping and downtown.

Highly recommend a stay at this location.",1.0

Chicago,Ellie’s place is exactly what you see in the all - no false advertising. It’s very light and open and she maximizes the space greatly. She’s very easy to communicate with. The Damen & Western L stations are close enough walk which we utilized a lot. Would definitely stay here again!,1.0
Chicago,"Gorgeous! I loved staying here. It was in a cool neighborhood and the studio was clean, styled well, and the bathroom was top notch. I want to stay here every time I come back to Chicago. They also have postcards and stamps for your use. Sweet little detail. Thanks so much!",1.0

Chicago,"This is a gem of a space that is a close walk to some great cafes, shopping, and night life. As someone who travels a fair amount, I would say this was one of my favorite stays at an AirBNB. The space itself is very thoughtfully curated. ",1.0
Chicago,"There is a reason so many reviews start with how stylish the place is. That reason is because it is stunning and just as advertised! The level of detail and thought put in to the design is unbelievable.   Location is great, quick walk to the blue line. Check in/out is super easy, and the studio manual made our interactions minimal.   Great place to stay, will absolutely repeat.   Thanks again!",1.0
Chicago,"This place was great. It's worth the price just to swim around in that huge bathtub. Ellie was a great host, and the apartment had everything you could need for a great time in Chicago. I found most places I needed to go (food, cute shops, metro) to be about a ~10 min walk away, which I don't mind because I love to walk, but if you don't consider getting a car. It was really easy to get to downtown using the train. I have no complaints, this was an awesome  place!",1.0
Chicago,"This is such a cute, clean and comfortable space! I could stay here for weeks! Nice little neighborhood. Had initially worried about noise at night, but it did quiet down for a restful evening.  The fresh ground coffee, sodas, beer help to make it comfortable. Nice distance from downtown. Safe to run in the mornings with a park nearby. Love this place!",1.0
Chicago,"Ellie’s studio is absolutely stunning! She goes above & beyond for her guest! There are loads of local nicknacks laying around the studio to indulge into. She has her cabinets stocked with things one might need (ibuprofen, cotton swabs, razors, etc). The neighbor hood is very nice. There are not many of taxi’s in the area, so if you don’t drive one might want to download uber. Definitely worth the stay! Would definitely come back!",1.0
Chicago,"Fantastic stay! The studio was as pristine as pictured. You felt more like you were staying in a hotel than someone's home. Great amenities like shampoo, soft towels and even yoga mats! Would highly recommend,",1.0
Chicago,"Elinor's studio was a magical place, and I could tell as I soon as I stepped up to the door, because care was taken in styling the exterior with little faerie lights that sparkled. I hate to say this, but I can be a bit of snob when it comes aesthetic and decor. I have not one complaint about this studio. I was absolutely blown away. The incredible level of detail and design, even down to the studio's handbook was meticulous and thought out.  What's even more wonderful is the central location to all the haunts in the Bucktown/Wicker Park area. I drove and literally everywhere I went was less than a 10 minutes away. I can't imagine that taking public transportation would take any longer. If you do drive, Elinor provides a parking permit, which gives you the freedom to park anywhere in the vivinity without the fear of getting a ticket.  By far Elinor's place is one of the best spots I've stayed in for Air BnB. If you're looking for something magical and romantic (oh, I forgot to mention there's wonderfully restored claw-foot Victorian bath tub) look no further.",1.0
Chicago,Stayed here while visiting Chicago. The apartment was really clean and cozy and located in a really good location for our trip. We were able to park right out front for our stay and walk everywhere. If you're looking to spend time in the Ukrainian Village i would recommend staying here. Close to the train if ya want to travel other places too.,1.0
Chicago,"The initial observation of the space was of course a stylish space for a reasonable price.  Seeing the space in person is such an enjoyable experience - especially when noticing all the fine details not revealed in the online pics.  It is in those details that raises the level of impression and sets it apart from other spaces.    Elinor and I had minimal contact, but that was because instructions were clear on the check-in and check-out procedures, where to park, and even how to make the coffee - which we were thoroughly confused at first.    I enjoy exploring different places to stay when visiting areas, but I would consider staying here again on my next trip to Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"I enjoyed my stay at Elinor's studio apartment in Wicker Park.  The location was pefect for me.  The studio was quite stylish and had many personal touches, including a studio manual which I found quite helpful and fun.  I really appreciated the 2 bottles of wine and the beer selection in the fridge.  The kitchen was minimal but that was fine with me because I planned to enjoy Chicago's dining scene.  The bed was  very confortable, which was a definite plus.  The heater was somewhat louder than I was expecting, but that is the only concern I had.  I would definitely stay here again.",1.0
Chicago,"This is a great spot. Located near hip Wicker Park and related. Quiet, good access to Metro and very pleasant spot to hang out and do some work too. Hostess was very helpful on restaurants etc . This is a top BnB!!!",1.0
Chicago,"The space is exactly as described. Gorgeous. The bathroom is stylish, clean, and the shower is great. Would love to have a space like that in my own home tbh. They have cute touches throughout the studio, including Where Chefs Eat (I have that at home too!) and Studs Terkel's ""Working"" in the bathroom. The bed was really comfortable and once we figured out how to configure the NEST properly for our purposes, the temperature control was on point. One minor note is that both heat and cool air come out predominantly at the head of the bed, and it could be bothersome to people who are sensitive to dry air. My wife had to turn to the foot of the bed one night because she's super sensitive, but it didn't bother me much. The location was good for me because I don't need to be right downtown and don't mind taking a Lyft everywhere, plus I like to be in ""real"" neighborhoods. Puerto Rican restaurants abound as well as cool street art, if you care to venture around. It's about a twenty minute drive to many downtown area attractions. The hosts were very accommodating to my needs, as I had to cancel one day due to a family emergency. They were very easy to work with throughout. Will definitely look to return here my next stay in Chicago",1.0
Chicago,Elinor's place is close to perfect. Every corner of the space is thoughtfully detailed and styled. It's located very centrally to Logan Square and the Bucktown/Wicker Park area and I enjoyed walking the neighborhood in my downtime. Her communication was clear and extremely quick and I truly cannot say enough about how pleasant my stay was. Highly recommended.,1.0
Chicago,"Before I arrived, I loved the photos and thought the place would be perfect for my stay over New Year's. Walking in, it was somehow even better. From the furniture to the lighting to the tableware, everything in the space is very intentionally curated. I have a feeling the owners are designers; the whole place has a great aesthetic while still being comfortable. One of my favorite places I've stayed so far",1.0
Chicago,"We had a great stay at this charming, stylish studio. Clean digs and thoughtful touches like coffee, beer, and wine were lovely. Location was perfect for getting around town by foot or Lyft, yet the street itself was quiet and residential. Great host communication and simple check in and check out. Would stay again in a heartbeat!",1.0
Chicago,"I love this spot . The layout, decor and vibe are definitely hip. Everything is so easy + the communication with Elinor is on point. The amenities are great . The experience is very hommie , every time you discover little details that make a difference in your stay.   If you’re looking for something local, not loud ,  away from tourists this is definitely a good location.",1.0
Chicago,"Ellie’s place is so so wonderful! Chic, stylish, beautiful location from which you can easily access the trendiest Chicago area, Wicker Park. Ellie responds in mere minutes should you need anything and the keypad entry makes it so easy to come and go as you please, no need for keys! 10/10 would recommend and hope to stay here again! ❤️",1.0
Chicago,"Beautiful decor with so much space! Instructions for checkin were easy to follow. The coffee and extras were great!  Very comfortable bed! The apartment has an urban ambiance. Jeremy provided parking passes and we were able to find parking a block away. Communication was excellent. Jeremy answered any questions I had almost immediately. Neighborhood had a safe feel. We walked to local restaurants close by. One unfortunate thing, which was no fault of our host- when we went to leave, we discoveredthat our catalytic converter was stolen off of our car. I had driven our older SUV since I knew it would be parked for several days. Turns out, these are easiervehicles to get under and cut. I would not hesitate to stay here again.",1.0
Chicago,"This Airbnb is the best! Location and space are the key highlights! Jeremy has great design taste! Close to the train and many restaurants. We would definitely stay here again! If you’re visiting, try the rolled ice cream across the street! We had it twice!",1.0
Chicago,"The apartment was absolutely fantastic and everything was as good as advertised. The entire unit was much more spacious than it appeared in the photos which was a welcomed surprise as I have stayed in several Airbnb's that were smaller than photographed.   You could not ask for a better location, one block from the blue line which made traveling to/from O'Hare and into downtown a breeze. You're also within walking distance to countless top notch restaurants and shops.  Jeremy was a very responsive and accommodating host and he really made us feel taken care of when we had some flight plan changes. I would recommend this apartment to anyone wanting to visit Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"There is much to like about this apartment.  It's spacious, has full amenities, plenty of character, parking is included, and the place is clean.  Wicker Park is growing, has a unique vibe, feels safe, and offers options within walking distance for groceries.  The area also has many choices for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and drinks.  We chose to use the kitchen for breakfast, and the waffle maker was a great perk.  A critical factor in comfort, rest and relaxation is the bed.  While clean, we found the mattress to be uncomfortable.  It currently presents itself as firm and lumpy with indentations and sag from years of use.  Upgrading this one very important item would make this location, apartment, and experience worth renting again.  We enjoyed our stay overall and will keep this as an option in the future.",1.0
Chicago,"Came to Chicago for my cousin's birthday party. It was in my old neighborhood, so I felt very much at home. The place was spacious and exactly how it was described! I briefly meet Jeremy when I arrived, he was extremely nice. Would love to come back here when I visit Chicago again.",1.0
Chicago,"I loved this loft and everything about it.  The location was great - 1.5 blocks from the CTA - we were able to explore the entire city using public transportation.  Check in and check out were a breeze.  Jeremy was kind and offered great suggestions when we met briefly during the stay.  The apartment was spotlessly clean, comfortable, quiet and well appointed.  This was my first visit to Chicago and I would gladly stay here on my next trip.",1.0
Chicago,"We loved this place. It's spacious and very convenient. If you have small children, you may want to know that there is a firehouse nearby, but it did not bother us, we expected city noises. There's a Metro station barely a block away. It's great to have a washer and dryer right in the apartment since we tend to pack very lightly. We greatly appreciated the neighborhood parking stickers Jeremey provided and we easily found parking about 1 block away on a safe, residential street. We'll stay here again next time we're in town.",1.0
Chicago,"This is a large, 1 bedroom apartment within 2 blocks of the blue line. Very convenient! There’s a well equipped full kitchen with a small grocery across the street. Of course there a numerous great restaurants in the area so there’s no need to cook. The apartment was very comfortable and clean. We had plenty of pillows, blankets, towels etc. which was much appreciated.",1.0
Chicago,"This was my very first AirBnB and if all of them are like this one, I'll never stay in a hotel again. Jeremey's communication was excellent from start to finish and his home is so beautiful and immaculate. It is easy to find and right off the blue line. The home had EVERYTHING I needed and then some. He even left me 2 day parking passes for the area which made people coming by easy to park nearby. It is in a very cool neighborhood and as a single woman staying in an area I've never been, I felt very safe. When I visit again, I would definitely stay there again.",1.0
Chicago,Jeremey is a wonderful host and his place is extremely nice. He is quick to respond with any questions and is willing to give recommendations around the city. The place was clean and decorated with care. It has everything you would need during your stay.,1.0
Chicago,"Jeremy's apartment is exactly as advertised - stylish, large, comfortable and spotlessly clean in a very safe, hip neighborhood.  The kitchen has all you would need to fix your own meals.  We, however, opted to take advantage of the multitude of excellent bars, coffee shops and restaurants within very easy walking distance on Division Street and North Milwaukee Avenue (for lovers of high quality Nepalese / Indian food we recommend Cumin on North Milwaukee). Communication with Jeremy was very easy.  If and when we return to this part of Chicago Wicker we would, without hesitation choose to stay in Jeremy's place.",1.0
Chicago,"We were very pleased with the apartment. With an updated modern kitchen and bathroom we had everything we needed to be comfortable. Jeremy was a great host, communicated all details we needed when needed.",1.0
Chicago,Jeremy's place was fantastic! It is really big. Was great to unpack and have space and feel at home. Really close to the blue line. Easy to get anywhere. Felt safe in the neighborhood. Fire station next door but never bothered us or woke us up. Would definitely stay again!,1.0
Chicago,Our stay was great! Jeremey was very responsive when we asked him about accommodating our two dogs during the stay. There was even a small crate provided that we ended up using for the smaller pup. Everything was just as described and the apartment is close to many great restaurants and shops. We'd stay again! :),1.0
Chicago,"Jeremey's place is fantastic -- it's bigger than we were expecting and has a really nice overall feel to it.  It's nicely decorated and has all the amenities you would need.  Jeremey was very quick to respond to messages and helped out if anything at all was needed.  Check-in was simple and the building felt secure.  It's just a couple minutes' walk to the blue line, which brings you right into downtown in about 10 minutes.  Also close to some cool spots on N Milwaukee, like Oiistar, the amazing ramen place.  Super nice experience and we'd definitely stay with Jeremey again!",1.0
Chicago,"This was perfect for our needs.  Everything was as advertised.  It's a beautiful space and the location is great.  (Ashland itself is not too appealing but you're a one-minute walk from blue line, can stroll west on Division or walk up Milwaukee Ave to Bucktown.).  Self-checkin was super easy and we had everything we needed.",1.0
Chicago,"Jeremy was very responsive, answering all questions quickly and thoroughly.  His place was nice and very clean.  My parents stayed at the Air BnB to visit me and were quite pleased.  Being that I own and live in downtown Chicago, I can say that this location fantastic and the price to be a great value.",1.0
Chicago,This place is one of the nicest accommodations I have ever stayed at. Yes the price is expensive compared to a hotel but if you want a solid night's sleep and little slice of home be sure to check out Jeremy's place!,1.0
Chicago,Wonderful place.  We really enjoyed ourselves and relaxed at Jeremey's loft.  Very clean.  We enjoyed being able to watch people on the streets from the loft.  Love the mixture of cultures which we don't get much of back home.  Location was great.  Very quick walk to get to Wicker Park and many great local restaurants as well.  Felt very safe in the neighborhood and at Jeremey's place.  Super nice people.  Jeremey is fantastic at returning messages.  Always a quick reply and we had no problems at all that couldn't be fixed quickly.  Highly recommend Jeremey's loft!,1.0
Chicago,"Jeremey's apartment far exceeded our expectations.  The pictures don't do justice to how beautiful, stylish and very spacious this place is, not to mention comfortable and clean.  Everything was simply perfect.  Every possible amenity to make you feel right at home--we wanted for nothing.  Comfortable bed and couches, beautiful, roomy bathroom with large shower and plenty of hot water, fully stocked kitchen, excellent wi-fi and incredibly easy check-in process. We loved the location, merely 2 short blocks (roughly 3 min) walk to the Blue line on the L/ subway.  So easy to get to the main attractions downtown, but also in a great spot to explore the Wicker Park/ West Town neighborhoods and all the great restaurants and shops.  An excellent Airbnb experience--Thank you, Jeremey!!",1.0
Chicago,We found it exactly as advertised—perhaps even better. Super accommodations in a great location. Jeremey was very accessible and promptly responded to our requests and questions. We look forward to staying there again on our next trip to Chicago.,1.0
Chicago,We LOVED the location. The area seemed very safe and was central to the blue line and a Divvy bike station. (Tip: take the blue line to and from O’hare to save a lot of money on transportation) The apartment was very roomy and we enjoyed having access to a kitchen. Something to note is the TV does not have cable or “smart” access. We ended up buying a firestick so we had something to watch while winding down at the end of our days. Jeremy was quick to respond any time we had questions or needed anything! Thank you for a great stay!,1.0
Chicago,"Better than it looked online, a beautiful space with everything needed and then some. Great location, close to public transportation and wonderful local spots. Jeremy was attentive and helpful with all of my queries. Would stay here whenever I’m in Chicago. Can’t recom enough!",1.0
Chicago,"This is a beautiful unit in a great neighborhood in Chicago.  Jeremy was a great host and was easy to communicate with.  Check-in and check-out were a breeze and the apartment was spotless.  It's on a busy street but there was very little noise.  The blue line is a block away as are Target, CVS and a bunch of great coffee shops and places to eat.  Also super easy to pick up a cab or an Uber/Lyft.  Would recommend this place without hesitation!",1.0
Chicago,Communication was fast and easy and Jeremey was available every step of the way.    Apartment was better than I expected.  Great location and very close to the Blue Line which can get you just about anywhere.     Would absolutely recommend and would stay here again in the future.   ,1.0
Chicago,"This is a spacious apartment and very nicely furnished. The location is just a few minutes walk from the blue line with quick transportation direct to the heart of downtown. Check-in was easy and the host provided a sheet with lots of helpful suggestions for local eating places, of which there are many.  Staying at Jeremey's place for 4 nights provided a very comfortable place to stay for our tired bodies after spending our days exploring Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,Jeremey’s place is very spacious and clean.  It has everything you need for a short or long term stay.  Jeremey is very nice and answers any question very promptly.  The location is also very convenient for travel on public transport.  Highly recommended!,1.0
Chicago,"Couldn't have asked for a better place. It was super easy to get to and from both town and O'Hare, with a Blue Line stop only one block away. It was beautiful and cheerful as well. Loved the full kitchen and nice extra-large tub. Jeremey was a lovely host. I wish we could have stayed even longer!",1.0
Chicago,"Great location with convenient transportation. The neighborhood has a cool vibe. As a vinyl record collector, I was excited about being across the street from Dusty Groove and close to Reckless Records. Great overall experience.",1.0
Chicago,"My wife and I spent 2 nights at Jeremey's place. While pictures can often be deceiving, we were pleasantly surprised at how large and open the apartment was in person. It was perfect. Jeremey was traveling in Spain at the time, but he was quick to respond to questions we had the day of and during the trip about things such as checking in and adjusting the nest thermostat. We'd happily stay there again.",1.0
Chicago,Great space in a convenient location—a vibrant neighborhood and just a block from blue line. The apartment has a good vibe and personality and is very clean. Jeremy was attentive and responsive. I’ll go back.,1.0
Chicago,"Jeremey's apartment is really great. It's large and bright in all the right places (and quieter and darker in the bedroom, which is lovely for sleeping), stylishly decorated (without being overdone--the decor fits the urban space perfectly), has a fantastic shower, everything you need for a comfortable stay and is in one of my favorite Chicago neighborhoods, with a bajiggety restaurants, bars, shops, etc. The provided parking passes are super helpful, especially for weekend stays, because parking in this part of the city is no joke (in fact, if you can manage without a car, do, because you won't need it once you're here--everything is walkable, lyft/uber is plentiful and the El train is literally right there.)  If mobility is an issue for you, you should know that you have to walk up a flight of steep, narrow stairs to get to the apartment. Also, it's really in the real city, and real cities generally aren't that quiet, so if you're a super sensitive sleeper who needs deep, dark silence, you'll maybe want to bring ear plugs and/or a sleep mask.   But otherwise, I completely recommend this place. Jeremey is a kind, helpful and responsive host, the apartment is so lovely, and it's a really great value for Chicago, too.",1.0
Chicago,"We enjoyed our stay at Jeremy’s place. It's conveniently located, about 15 minutes to the loop and 20 minutes to Midway airport. Although we got around with Uber, the blue line is just minutes across the street. The apartment is super clean and lovely decorated. Jeremy is very thoughtful with the travel guide and tips. It was great to meet a Cal alumni at Chicago. =) I would recommend this listing to everyone.",1.0
Chicago,"This home was great. Jeremey provided easy check in details and instructions. The location was great because I was close to everything downtown and many shops and stores. I recommend this home and would certainly stay here again. Thanks again, Jeremey!",1.0
Chicago,"Jeremy was easily accessible for any questions via text and he even checked in the second day to make sure everything was okay. The apartment spacious, comfortable and centrally located. Just a few steps to the blue line CTA train, restaurants and shops. The neighborhood is busy so the provided parking permits were a huge plus.",1.0
Chicago,"This space is amazing. Plenty of room, furnishings are great, kitchen has everything you could need, and the shower was perfect after a long day of exploring Chicago in the cold. Jeremey was prompt with responses and great about giving me tips on places to check out. Literally just a few steps away from the Blue Line which made getting around the city super easy. I will definitely be looking to get this place again next time I am in Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"Great place! We stayed there with our 18month during our summer holiday trip, all three of us loved Jeremey’s place. Bigger than expected. Jeremey was very supportive and fast with all kind of questions. We can highly recommend this place, also when you are traveling with small children.",1.0
Chicago,"What a great stay in Chicago!!! Jeremey‘s loft is perfectly situated in one of our favourite areas within Chicago. There are so many things to explore in walking distance: restaurants, shopping, parks, and the great 606 trail. The train („L“, blue line) - which is more or less directly in front of the apartment - connects you directly with downtown as well as with the airport. The apartment is so cool, we would love to live there! Despite the busy street in front of the house the apartments inside is so quiet and we slept like babies. Jeremey is a fantastic host and helped us a lot to find our ways, gave us great recommendations and answered immediately whenever we wrote a message. We will definitely come again!!!",1.0
Chicago,"A very spacious and spotlessly clean apartment, it holds special charm with bare brick walls and wooden floors with plenty of seating and a very large bed with a well equipped dressing room.  The bathroom is great with a very impressive bath for easing away the muscles after a long day of exploring.  We didn’t use the kitchen much apart from making a hot drink as we ate out most of the time but there is a great health food shop just opposite and a food shop just by the subway station.  Although we didn’t get to meet Jeremey his communication with us was superb.",1.0
Chicago,"Jeremy’s place is amazing, not only is it huge, it has everything you need for a comfortable stay, it’s in a great location for getting around town (literally one minute walk from the blue line at Division), and really easy to get to on the blue line from O’hare airport.  Jeremy was a fantastic host, very quick to respond to any queries we had, and was kind enough to let us leave our bags for a couple of hours while we went for brunch before heading back to the airport.  I would highly recommend his apartment to anyone wanting to explore Chicago.",1.0

Chicago,"Jeremey’s place is so beautiful, a perfect loft you could imagine with a view to a quiet street. It has lots of light, in the morning or in the evening too. Subway is 1 minute walking distance (literally)! Fire station in the adjacent building is not bothering at all, they turned out to be the most quiet neighbors we ever had :) Many thanks to Jeremey, we would like to return!",1.0
Chicago,Beautiful apartment thats is decorated to perfection. Its conveniently located (10 min walk to wicker park and 20 min subway to downtown). Jeremy was very accommodating and his local coffee & donut tips were great!,1.0
Chicago,"Rob’s place was beautiful! It looked exactly as advertised. The apartment was spacious & stylishly decorated. Lots of restaurants & bars within walking distance, as well as a grocery store. Rob was super responsive & hospitable. We were not able to check in before 3, but he allowed us to leave our luggage in his store prior to check in & even took it upstairs to the apartment for us! The only downside was that the bedroom can get a little warm, especially on a hot summer day. Other than that, we fully enjoyed our stay. Would definitely stay here again!",1.0
Chicago,"Rob’s Place was beautifully furnished and decorated. It was also only a 3 minute walk from the nearest bus stop which can take you to downtown or any of the metro/L lines - very convenient. The only downside is that there is no air conditioning in the bedroom so it got really hot. It is also on the 3rd floor so that’s something to consider if you don’t like taking the stairs. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and would recommend it!",1.0
Chicago,Rob's place is immaculate! I have never seen an Airbnb so tastefully decorated and cozy. Its in the middle of a bustling restaurant and shopping district but is surprisingly quiet. Rob himself was very responsive and a great host. I would definitely come back here for sure. Make sure you take advantage of the $20/day parking that Rob offers. It was a lifesaver.,1.0
Chicago,"My experience could not have been better. This was the mog immaculate, stylish, modern, and comfortable AirBnB experience I've ever had. The owner has spared no expense, from stainless steel alliances to remodeled bathrooms and showers, to new wood flooring. The temper-pedic bed was heavenly, and the furnishings were modern and comfortable. The attention to detail was unparalleled, from train maps and restaurant guides to Chicago artwork and plenty of cooking utensils and supplies, as well as beauty and hygiene products. I was beyond impressed with the level of care and consideration.   When I return to Chicago in the future, this will be my first choice. Always.",1.0
Chicago,We were In Chicago to see Hamilton and sightsee with our teenaged daughter. We loved this location and neighborhood. It felt safe and there were tons of nearby places to eat or get groceries. The condo itself was extremely clean and was well stocked with necessities. It was spacious and we never felt crowded. Rob was a great host and was very responsive to our questions. It was a plus to have  parking available as we never moved our car until we left Chicago. I would definitely rent from Rob again,1.0
Chicago,"Rob's place is incredibly stylish, supremely located, and overall provides a comfortable, beautiful perch from which to explore the city of Chicago.  As a host, Rob was incredibly hospitable and communicative, and was very helpful in getting me situated for the stay.  I highly recommend the apartment and would definitely stay here again!",1.0
Chicago,"This place is a fantastic stay!  Everything is wonderfully decorated, well thought-out, very clean, and it has an authenticity you can only find in a beautiful historic building.  The location is great as well. It’s a 13 minute drive to downtown Chicago, and 500 feet from the best breakfast place in town “Whisk”. You must go there!  Only thing missing in the Airbnb was coffee, so you may want to bring your own. But they have multiple ways to make it if you do.  Great stay, highly recommend this Airbnb!",1.0
Chicago,My wife and I came in to Chicago for our wedding anniversary and are so glad we chose to stay with Rob.  Probably the best Airbnb experience we’ve had.  He really thinks of everything and we can’t recommend staying here enough.,1.0
Chicago,Rob’ s space is 5 stars & beyond. He has gone the extra steps to make his guests well informed about the neighborhood & totally took care of everything you need to be comfortable away from your home.

Chicago,"By far-this Rob's place is the most STUNNING home my husband and I stayed in. The décor is stylish, modern and pure class. The Holiday decorations made it festive and cozy. I really want those flocked trees!! LOL Absolutely gorgeous. The pictures of this listing does it NO JUSTICE!! Rob is a delight and one of thee most gracious hosts I have encountered. His level of hospitality is unparalleled and he gave us some great suggestions of local eateries in the area. His home is in great proximity to downtown and other neighborhoods. We truly could not be more pleased and dreaded leaving to return back to our home state. However, we will certainly be back and definitely in the process of making plans to book Rob's home again. You will not be disappointed!! Truly his home is a GEM!!!",1.0
Chicago,"The warmest home we've ever been in. Sparkling clean, modern and superb interior design, great location and a very lovely, warm host. Thank you, Rob and we promise to only stay at your place whenever we're in Chicago! An experience to remember!",1.0
Chicago,"This was the cleanest Airbnb we’ve ever stayed in. If you are picky with finding a clean place that actually FEELS clean, this home is for you. You can immediately tell that Rob takes pride in his apartment and everything is so well maintained and stylishly decorated. The bed was a welcomed place for rest after a long day, and we loved how firm the mattress was and how fluffy the pillows were—very comfortable.  The amenities were spot on, the coffeemaker, the gas stove, plenty of dishes and quality cookware to use for making a meal. Not mention, the exceptional decor of the entire apartment! The location was excellent and walkable to numerous local restaurants and bars (a few were literally steps from the apartment door). We loved being on the third floor and always felt super safe. There is some traffic noise that can be heard in the bedroom, but Rob provides earplugs for light sleepers. In truth, we actually enjoyed being lulled to sleep by the sounds of the city and it didn’t bother us at all. The convenience of the grocery store being a 5 minute walk away made buying some pantry and fridge essentials easy. The couch in the living room was super comfy and perfect for relaxing and watching the Thanksgiving Day parade and some Netflix Christmas movies. This was the perfect Airbnb and we were highly impressed (not always easy). 5 stars to Rob for such an amazingly clean, comfortable, stylish, and well thought out home away from home. We’ll be back soon!",1.0
Chicago,"This place is so much nicer in person! And wow the bed was so comfortable we ended up sleeping the first night we got there instead of going out because we got trapped in the bed lol. Communicating with Rob was very easy and his home was supplied with everything!! First aid kit, make up remover wipes you name it lol. The home is in a very quiet and safe neighborhood. Would definitely stay again, one of the nicest places I have ever stayed!",1.0
Chicago,"We had a short but wonderful stay at Rob's place for a weekend trip to Chicago. Communication and check-in were quick and easy, and it was a breeze to get there from the airport on the train and a bus.  The space was spotlessly clean and beautifully furnished, with thoughtful touches that made our stay really comfortable. The location is great too, with a grocery store nearby and lots of good food/drink options as well.  Our only regrets are that we didn't stay here longer to enjoy it more and that we had to catch a Sunday morning flight before we could peruse the beautiful store downstairs some more. We would definitely stay here again, and will happily recommend it to any family and friends who may be looking for a place to stay in Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"Rob’s apartment was exactly what we need for a wonderful stay in Chicago. It was styled beautifully and Rob provided everything we could possibly need- thought of everything!

Chicago,"Rob’s place is one of the nicest, best located, and real value of all the places we have stayed!

Looking forward to staying here next time we visit Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"The best place I’ve ever stayed at! Decorated to the 9s, home included everything I never even thought of - including band aids and bath salts for a lovely soak!

There’s a grocery store right nearby and nice shops and restaurants for a true neighborhood experience. I was in town for a conference and it was a quick drive or bus/train into the Loop. I will most certainly stay here again.",1.0
Chicago,"This might be my favorite Airbnb stay to date. The apartment so stunning, clean, and comfortable and charming Ukrainian Village with so much to offer, we chose to make fewer trips into the heart of the city to spend more time enjoying and exploring the immediate surroundings both in and out of the apartment.

Chicago,Rob’s place was amazing. Right in the center of everything. The location was close to many restaurants and bars. It is also a short ride to surrounding neighborhoods and downtown. The place itself was amazing with all the amenities needed for a great stay. Rob was prompt in his communication and was right below if needed. The parking space was a bonus as it is hard to find parking in this neighborhood without a permit.,1.0
Chicago,"Location, atmosphere, beautiful decor, every thought to amenities (even a First Aid Kit!)... you simply can't go wrong with this great condo in Ukrainian Village.  It was a snowy weekend so we especially enjoyed the cabinet full of games!  We were visiting family in Streeterville and getting there was no problem at all.  Rob greeted us when I arrived, and check-out was very simple.  Also, my brother drove over from a neighboring city to meet me, so we appreciated the off-street parking for him and his daughter.  Stay with Rob!  You won't regret it.",1.0

Extremely clean. Special touches such as video games and snacks. Went above and beyond to provide a welcoming and safe environment. Room was stylized, modern. Plenty of amenities, even access to laundry. If we make our way back to town, we’ll stay here again. Thank you for making our first AirBNB memorable!",1.0
Chicago,"Great place to stay! Very clean and convenient to food and shops! Reminded me of being Ina little apartment. The shower was a bit small, so if you're a larger person it may be difficult to fit. But it was a very nice place and the host were quick to respond.",1.0

The decor is fantastic and we loved many of the little touches including the board games, tasteful art, game systems, and the water and drinks in the fridge were a welcome surprise after our evening arrival. Having central heat as well as a space heater in the unit helped make sure we stayed nice and toasty during our visit. We didn't take advantage of them, but the fact that a washer and dryer were available was a nice bonus.   We'll definitely look here first on our next trip to Chicago!",1.0

Chicago,"What a gem! Christopher’s place was exactly as described including a ton of extras. Christopher was quick to respond before and during my stay. He left a light on for me the night I arrived since I had a super late flight. He even checked in on me the next day to make sure I had everything I needed. The place was totally spotless. The bed was very comfy and there were tons of extra pillows. The kitchen was fully equipped and he even stocked it with several quick food items. These were much appreciated especially the first morning. The space felt so much more roomy than I was expecting. Ceilings are a bit lower being a garden unit but I had no problem at all with it. The water pressure in the shower was really great. Christopher made a really detailed welcome guide with lots of great info abt the neighborhood. The studio is only 3 short blocks away from a bus that takes you directly to the belmont el station (abt a 20-30 min ride). I felt very safe in the neighborhood (family vibe) even when coming in using transit late at night by myself. If you are wanting to do a lot of things in the Loop, transit took me 45-hour sometimes depending on the time of day. This was not a big deal for me bc I wanted a neighborhood experience vs more of a downtown touristy one, but it did take longer to get to and from. Lastly, Christopher was kind enough to  hold my luggage for me on my last day since I had a later flight. All in all, fantastic experience and I highly recommend this listing. Thank you so much, Christopher!",1.0
Chicago,Christopher’s place was was everything I could have hoped for. It was a nice cozy place where my girlfriend and I felt immediately at home.

Chicago,This is such a great place to stay! Awesome location between the airport and downtown. Uber’s were always there within 5 minutes and were reasonably priced for a ride to anywhere in the city.

Transportation was nearby and made our rides to the city very convinient, also we got to explore more of it by using transportation.

Chicago,"We found this to be a much better alternative to expensive hotels. This apartment was private, quiet, and clean. Parking on the street was easy. Chris was very helpful and communicative. The water in the fridge was appreciated! We only stayed one night, but this place has everything you'd need for an extended stay. ",1.0
Chicago,Chris was an amazing host.  His place was very clean and better than we expected.  This was the wife’s first time visiting Chicago and she wasn’t disappointed as this place offers a lot of space for two guests.  Parking on the same street was hit and miss but that can be expected for a big city.  We took Lyft anytime we were visiting downtown Chicago.  It was nice to come and go as we pleased.  Chris responded very quickly to any messages that were sent.  I felt safe enough walking in the general neighborhood.  When we visit Chicago again this would definitely be the first choice.  Our first host cancelled which brought us to finding this gem.,1.0

Chicago,"Samantha & Jonathan's loft was exactly as pictured, and located in a convenient location. I loved the apartment - I would love to live here myself! The stairs to the loft was quite steep as others describe, and I left my suitcase downstairs and only went upstairs to sleep. The bed was very comfortable. My friend whom I stayed with wanted an easy access to the bathroom during night, so she decided to use the air mattress downstairs, which we found in the closet (we moved furnitures around to make space). The walk to the California CTA station was 15-20 min for me, but since it was quite a cold week, I often opted for Uber. As we had packed plans in downtown, we did not get to explore much of the neighborhood nor get to ask for neighborhood tips that Samantha was happy to share, but I'd love to come back to this loft and explore more!",1.0
Chicago,"The loft is located in a great quiet spot that is walking distance from great restaurants and bars. It was a ~15 minute walk from both the Logan Square and California blue line stops, and extremely close to tons and tons of good restaurants and bars (check out Lula, Giant, and Longman & Eagle). Samantha was a great host and the place was spotless when we arrived, with tea and some nice snacks sitting on the table. Checking in and out was as easy and quick as it gets, and we appreciated Samantha periodically messaging us to check on our experience. We would stay here again in a heartbeat. Our only warning is that all the stairs in the building are extremely steep and narrow. We didn't have any problems, but you should be careful. Overall a 5/5 experience.",1.0
Chicago,"The space is exactly as pictured.  Simple, basic, perfect for one or two people.  The bed in the loft was comfortable and the HDTV had plenty of premium channels.

Major bus line is 3 blocks away that will take you straight to the northside Fullerton train stops and the Blue Line station that goes to the loop is about 8 blocks away.  The host is easily reached and communication was great.  Thanks!",1.0
Chicago,"I enjoyed my stay in this space! The studio itself was very clean and quiet during sleeping hours.

Chicago,"Samantha's place is absolutely marvelous! It's located in a nice residential area, with some fun bars and restaurants in the neighborhood. If you don't want to wait for a bus, it's a bit of a walk to the blue line, but nothing bad. Uber rides into the city were not that expensive and an easy way to get into the city. The apartment itself is really, really nice. Clean, spacious and an extremely comfy bed. I would highly recommend it to anybody!",1.0
Chicago,A very stylish flat with lots of complimentary toiletries and helpful guide books for the area. The flat isn’t in the city centre but taking an Uber carpool is a cheap and easy way of getting into the main part.,1.0
Chicago,This is a beautifully-designed loft apartment in an upmarket part of town.  It is sparkling clean and has some nice touches such as local coffee. Communication with Samantha was very smooth and she answered our questions quickly.  I would highly recommend staying here in Chicago.,1.0
Chicago,"Lovely apartment in a great area of the city.  Local amenities were perfect (I'd recommend Tony's for any grocery requirement and Wyler Road for a chilled drink and a bit to eat!) and not too far from the ""L"" to the Loop where it's a 20 min ride in.   Hosts were great and very responsive to any request and requirement we had and helped out as much as possible.  The stairs up to the mezzanine are definitely steep but we expected this from the description so not a problem at all and the apartment is carefully thought out to give maximum usability of the space.  Overall a fantastic expperience of this amazing city.",1.0
Chicago,"Place was amazing! My boyfriend and I absolutely loved our stay here in this loft. Area is very clean and very stylish. All of our questions were answered very fast and accurately. Everything was supplied for us, they even had Q-tips lol. ",1.0
Chicago,"We had an amazing stay at Samantha's place. It is located in a quiet neighborhood within 20min walking distance from the blue line. The apartment is spacious and has everything you need including cooking facilities, big comfortable bed, tv etc. We were a bit delayed and arrived late in the evening, but Samantha was extremely kind by helping us ordering pizza while we were absolutely wrecked from traveling. Furthermore, she always responded very quickly to questions from us. We ran in to her husband Jonathan a couple of times who was also super friendly and gave us a ton of advice on what to do in the city. Overall we had a great couple of days in Chicago and we definitely recommend this place! ",1.0
Chicago,"Samantha's place was perfect for our weekend getaway. Travel around the city was very convenient with transit and biking options very closeby. The space was extremely tidy and comfortable, and our hosts were very accommodating...thanks for a wonderful Chicago experience!",1.0
Chicago,"This apartment is great! The apartment itself is already beautiful and special with its high ceilings, and the location is also very nice. In walking distance from Logan square, with nice coffee bars, restaurants, shops and street art. But also in walking distance from public transport that takes you to downtown in just a few stops. We would definitely recommend this place for a great visit to this great city",1.0
Chicago,"Lovely loft studio, spotlessly clean and very well designed with everything we needed. Location is good with the metro about 15 mins walk away then 20 mins to downtown, and a Chicago bike scheme station 5mins away and an even quicker cycle to downtown. We also enjoyed the 606 trail, Chicago's answer to the Highline which is also close by.  So a great place and a great location.",1.0
Chicago,Beautiful apartment in quite neighborhood. The space is great it's location relative to public transit is awesome. Samantha was quick to respond to any questions. I will definitely be checking availability next time I'm back in Chicago.,1.0
Chicago,"We had a great stay at Logan Square. The appartment was spacious (more so than we expected) and very clean with thoughtful provisions provided.   Samantha and Jonathon provided us with a great list of nearby places do eat and drink (from fresh coffee to pizza) and were very helpful in communicating when we asked for help.   Logan Sqaure itself is a lovely leafy neighbourhood around half an hr from Downtown on the train. There's plenty of amenities a short walk from the appartment, as well as loads of great bars. A taxi into Downtown is quicker but more expensive.   The 'L' (elevated train) is a 15-20 min walk from the appt and then a further 15 min or so ride into downtown where there is plenty to do. A weekly ticket for the train is around $30 and gives you access to trains and buses. Very handy for getting around as the bus and L system is easy to use.  On a clear day, we would recommend hiring a bike and taking the Lake Shore route which runs alongside Lake Michigan. You get stunning views of the iconic skyscrapers from across the water.  Hancock Tower on a clear day is also a must see too, with great views for miles.  If the weather is cooler, then there are loads of great museums to visit. the History of Chicago by Lincoln Park is great. The Old Town is nearby for a drink afterwards too.  Definitely a great city to visit with lots to do, and a great appartment in a great neighbourhood. 10/10  Thanks",1.0
Chicago,"The apartment was lovely, clean, and the coffee/snacks were appreciated. The security within the apartment was great, and although the surrounding area was less confidence-inspiring, she had us send a photo of our car once we arrived, and the area had cameras, so it put me at ease. We were super close to both bus and train options that we utilized several times, and within walking distance of target for quick pick-ups. We enjoyed our stay!",1.0
Chicago,"Kay is the best superhost you will ever have!! She is great with communication and is very welcoming! Her apartment has a home-like feeling that will make your vacation even better. Cleanest place ever!! Absolutely spotless and smells amazing!!  If you are looking for suggestions of where to eat and shop, Kay will give you a list of her favorite places and provides a variety brochures, pamphlets, flyers, and food menu’s! I had mentioned my family was vegan and she gave me options of food choices around the area!  Great location!!! I highly recommend staying at Kay’s place if you are visiting Chicago!!",1.0
Chicago,"Kay’s place was very cute and clean!! She was super quick to respond to anything. The train is a quick walk from the apartment though I don’t think I would personally feel safe walking from the train tooo late at night as a young lady. Loved how she  had treats available like bananas, it’s, orange juice, coffee. It is very convenient for a quick trip to downtown Chicago!",1.0
Chicago,"Even though Kay's place was more on the south side of Chicago and I was going to the north side for a Cubs game, her place was great for a one-night stay with how reasonably priced it was right before Memorial Day weekend. I just got ubers to get to and from the game rather than public transit. Kay's place was very comfortable and she was a great host!",1.0
Chicago,"Kay’s place was amazing! Such thoughtful, kind touches, and Kay is super communicative. Seriously, this room was nicer and more well-equipped than some of the luxury hotel’s I’ve stayed at. 100% would stay here again!",1.0
Chicago,"From the extreme cleanliness of the apartment to the added extras everywhere you turn, this place was absolutely perfect! The host is respectful and generous with the most friendly senior kitty ever! Coming “home” to a snuggly feline in the living room was probably the best thing ever (I’m an extreme cat person). However, if you’re not into cats, no worries; the cat isn’t pushy and you could probably spend your entire trip ~not~ seeing him if that’s more your style. The off-street parking was clean and safe, something that can be hard to secure in Chicago. The apartment is located very close to both the train and the bus, making in-city traveling quite easy. I would highly recommend this AirBnB!",1.0
Chicago,It’s a wonderful and comfortable place to stay. Kay is really great at communicating with guests and is super nice and welcoming. The space is very clean and has a nice charm to it. We only stayed for one night but I definitely will keep this place in mind if I ever make it up to Chicago again.,1.0
Chicago,I extremely enjoyed my stay at Kay's place.  The location is perfect. My favorite part was having a Target with a Starbucks and market near by. This place is also closely located to a CTA and the freeway entrance if you have a car.  Kay provides many good ameneties and I was very happy for that. She is quickly responsive and super helpful. I'm glad I got to meet her. She is a sweet person.  It is 15 min away from the city.    Also if you have a rental/car there is parking near by!!!  Thanks Kay,1.0
Chicago,"Five stars isn’t enough! Kay made me feel very welcome and comfortable. I felt as if I was staying with family or an old friend, definitely not a stranger. She provided breakfast and coffee for me before I headed out and it definitely gave me a great start. I have a cat at my place, so their friendly lil guy made me feel even more at home. I would definitely recommend her to anyone else and will definitely stay with her again if the opportunity arises.",1.0
Chicago,"I was pleasantly surprised by how amazing the experience turned out to be at Kay's home. The entire house felt inviting and immediately puts you at ease. She puts the guest first and it shows in her thoughtful approach to outfitting the room. From soft bath towels and a loofah at your bedside, to the coffee and tea bar in the kitchen for hot drinks in the morning. She really wants you to feel like you are taken care of the moment you walk in the door. The location is convenient with good selection of restaurants in the area to choose from and downtown is a hop and a skip away for those who want to take in the sights. If it isn't obvious already,  I highly recommend staying with Kay during your trip to Chicago!",1.0
Chicago,"I stayed at Kay's place with two of my friends over St. Pat's weekend. The free parking was a huge blessing, and the apartment was very close to the CTA for local travel. The apartment itself was clean and well-kept. Kay was a wonderful host! From giving us travel recommendations to providing some St. Patrick's day accessories, she made our stay as enjoyable as possible. We also enjoyed helping ourselves to the coffee bar and playing with her adorable cat. All of our expectations for our stay were far exceeded and I would gladly stay here again.",1.0

Chicago,"Kay was a perfect host. She went out of her way to make sure I was comfortable and ensured I had everything I needed. Her place is so cute and even offers a breakfast bar with coffee, snacks and breakfast foods. She even left a loofa, towels and washcloths for me with chocolates. Also, there were loads of local brochures and magazines to browse. Her 16 year old cat Toby is such a love! He was super friendly and sweet. It was raining on the day I was going out to adventure in the city and I Kay was so cool about lending me her umbrella. She’s a kind soul and was so helpful with local tips for eats and getting around. Highly recommend staying at Kay’s!",1.0
Chicago,"Kay provided a great Airbnb! She was prompt in her responses and provided a few extra touches that made our stay very welcoming (water bottles in the room's mini-fridge, clear and prompt communication, breakfast items (although we skipped out on those), well-labeled instructions outside the door on how to get in as well as within the house to make things very clear, etc.)",1.0
Chicago,"Best Airbnb I've stayed in!

Kay was also super nice and accommodating. I would definitely stay here again and recommend to others!",1.0
Chicago,"Kay's place was perfect for me- free parking in a lot, close to the metro, and south (the direction I was coming from).  Kay is friendly, and her place is clean.  I'll definitely see if Kay's place is available the next time I  visit Chicago!",1.0
Chicago,Kay is an Amazing host with an air bnb that makes you feel at home! The entire house is sparkling clean and full of creative and cute decor. This room is spacious and fully furnished with all the amenities you may need. The check-in/out is simple with thorough instructions. The el (CTA train) is a short 5min walk in a safe neighborhood. This is the second time I’ve stayed here and both times there were other guests yet it was very quiet and comfortable stay and rest. Respect this space as it truly is a gem!,1.0
Chicago,Great stay. Kay’s place was in a great location close to downtown and public transportation. The room and bathroom were very clean and had nice touches. Didn’t meet Kay until the last night (my schedule) but she was very nice and personable. If definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone!! Thank you Kay,1.0

Chicago,"Kay's place was really awesome in a good neighborhood, easily accessible from public transport. Very highly recommended, especially for budget travelers like myself.   The apartment and room were cozy and I felt like being at home during my stay, with access to kitchen and living room area. The cat is super friendly too!   Kay as a person was a nice host. She even gave me some medicine upon request, as I was catching some cold from the weather in Chicago.   If I ever come back to Chicago I have a reliable place to stay :)",1.0
Chicago,"Kay is an absolute pro of a host.  She communicated check-in instructions very clearly and regularly  touched-base to make sure I had everything I needed during my stay.  Her place is ideally situated a mere 5 minute walk from an L train station (which is a fantastic way to get around Chicago as I discovered).  Very comfortable, clean, and safe place to spend your nights when visiting Chicago-- can't recommend enough.",1.0
Chicago,"The misfortune of staying at Kay's is that one will quickly realize that not every host will be like her! :-/ I was able to take the train (as she pre-stay suggested) directly out of midway and walk about 2 blocks & if cleanliness is next to godliness, then trust Kay has you covered. And to be completely honest, Kay extended herself to me in an act that goes way beyond the scope of AirBnb. I was comfortable, I felt safe, the room was very dedicated. Being that she was my 1st AirBnb experience,  I really feel like I lucked up. Omg, and her snack bar (fresh yummies), were too delish! :-* #BookHer",1.0
Chicago,"Kay is a fantastic host and I can not recommend her enough. When we contacted her for anything we needed, the response was lightning-fast! She was courteous and made her home warm and inviting for her guests. She really took a burden off our shoulders while planning a last-minute trip to Chicago. If you’re looking for a great experience for a really reasonable price, definitely book with Kay!",1.0
Chicago,"If I could give 6 stars I would. Kay's place was immaculate, cute, comfortable, easy to access — everything you could ask for in an Airbnb. Kay herself is an excellent and hospitable host, helping us out with umbrellas, breakfast, sunscreen, loofas — all the little things that shows she truly cares about making her guests' experience as amazing as possible. She is a gracious and generous person and I would 100% stay at her property again. ",1.0
Chicago,"If you don't like stairs or cats, that is the only reason not to stay here. Location is good, ample parking & light outdoors- ammenities are top & Kay is an awesome host with a BIG heart for her aging cat- that alone should make her 1st choice for any cat lover.",1.0
Chicago,Kay's place was absolutely amazing. She was a perfect host and made my vacation feel so comfortable. I was traveling alone and one late night she even messaged me to make sure I was ok.

As it was February in Chicago, we loved the fireplace to keep the space nice and warm. The flat was very clean, and stocked with towels and products for the shower. Danielle gave us a mega list of recommendations ahead of time, which was super helpful and full of cool restaurants and bars. The apartment is in Logan Square, and while we spent a good deal of time there and in places like Wicker Park, the freezing weather had us in lots of Uber’s downtown as well — just something to keep in mind. Though, it’s also off a subway line. Overall, no complaints, and Danielle’s communication was amazing. Would definitely recommend.",1.0
Chicago,I love love love Danielle's place.  It's extremely charming and well decorated. You can definitely tell she put a lot of effort into all the details of the apartment.

Chicago,"This has got to be in the top two best airbnb experiences I've had. Danielle's place is so cozy and looks amazing. We ended up spending a lazy Sunday lounging inside by the fireplace and watching dumb movies - an ideal way to spend a day after heavy touristing Friday and Saturday. She was incredibly accommodating throughout our stay with complications our party had with check in and check out. The surrounding area had an incredible pizza place, a bar where we got boozy ice cream floats, some breweries, and way more that we didn't have time to discover because we didn't want to leave the fire. Will 100% look to stay here again in the future!",1.0

Chicago,This was a truly desperate search for a safe place for my daughter to stay last minute while out of town.  She made last minute plans to travel to Chicago for the Gold Cup soccer match.  Once there she could not find a hotel to rent to her because she is 18.  She was in her car crying.  I booked with Jim on the internet and spoke with him by phone.  He was so great!!!  He met her and her boyfriend at the door.  He even spoke Spanish with her boyfriend which made him feel great.  He assured me by phone about how safe the neighborhood  was and that he would be on the premises just a moments notice away.  He treated them like adults but still helped me feel comfortable about their safety knowing they will always be my babies.  It was truly above and beyond.  And my daughter said the apartment was gorgeous.,1.0

Nice quiet neighborhood with Uber/lyft convenience to most city locations in 15-20 min. Apartment is on ground floor, some street noise but overall very quiet. Neighborhood is safe with quick walks to great eating spots. We recommend the little red wolf & mhenry.  Apartment is well furnished with nice appliances & conveniences, great WiFi. Host was attentive, but only needed on day 1: we’re pretty low key. Only recommendation would be additional blankets/ linens for pull out couch in living area.",1.0

Chicago,"Our stay in Chicago was great and we really enjoyed staying in Andersonville. It was far enough away to be quiet but only a 12-15 minute walk to the train station, which we didn’t mind at all. The neighborhood felt safe enough to walk in and we liked the local coffee shops and restaurants.   The apartment was nicely decorated and clean. I would just give a heads up that if you’re a light sleeper you can hear the hosts upstairs because it’s an old building. I would never take away a star for this because it’s just a personal thing. My wife is a heavy sleeper and it never bothered her but I had to download a white noise app on my phone to fall asleep.   The hosts were great communicators and asked if we needed anything and how our stay was going. We both enjoyed it and would stay here again!",1.0

Chicago,"Jim's place was FANTASTIC. The place was exactly what we expected it to be from the fabulous photos which were 100% accurate showing off the truly lovely and well decorated apartment. Very clean, well appointed, extra towels and pillows, fantastic magazines for relaxing reading, GREAT map of the local neighborhood in order to find fantastic local shops and places to eat.  You can totally get around on public transit (mostly CTA Bus) from this apartment. Note: the place is a little far from the CTA train stations into downtown. We rented a car and really appreciated the flexibility to get around the city easily and great neighborhood street parking.   The apartment is well appointed with everything you need for your stay. One of the bedrooms is street facing but there is not much traffic so it stayed very quiet at night. Air conditioning for the summer time is a huge plus on muggy hot days!  Andersonville neighborhood is one of my favorite areas of Chicago. It is quaint, full of local  charm, great eats and drinks within walking distance, and a fantastic way to get a feel of what real Chicago is like (and not the fake touristy stuff). Off the beaten path geek thing we did - we drove to and walked through the nearby Rosehill Cemetery Mausoleum. The old original section has a substantial collection of LC Tiffany stained glass windows and walking the completely silent hallways to see the sun shining through these beautiful windows is pretty awesome if you like that sort of thing.  Love Jim's place! Beyond 5 stars! We will hopefully be back to town and rent out his apartment again in the future. ",1.0

Had some great food and drinks there and it was nice to be in a quiet neighborhood outside the noise of the city.   The place is wonderfully appointed. Everything feels brand new and sparkling clean! Perfect for business stays or a nice getaway. You won't regret staying here.",1.0
Chicago,"This place was phenomenal. It was just as pictured, the location is awesome to the city we visited, both hosts handled any/all things we needed/checked up on us, and all of our necessities were met and beyond. This was a very pleasurable stay and I would definitely recommend this place to friends if they ever come visit Chicago.   You have everything you need within a short walk and if you really need to, there’s a Target .7 miles from the place. Close eating and bar spots within a short walk. It takes about 20-30 min to get into Chicago.   Awesome visit and great hosts.",1.0
Chicago,"Jim & Maximo we’re outstanding hosts. Every detail of this beautiful apartment was lovely. The location was great for our stay in north Chicago. And while our schedule did not allow for it, we appreciated the tips on where to go in the neighborhood. Communication was excellent, and the extra comforts made us feel very welcome and comfortable. And the decorations are so charming!",1.0
Chicago,This is our favorite place to stay in Chicago!   The location is excellent!  The apartment is beautiful!  Jim and Maximo are excellent hosts and think of added details to make you feel right at home.   We look forward to our next stay.,1.0
Chicago,"Amazing location, very walkable to all things that you need - restaurants, grocery stores, pharmacy, coffee shops, etc. worked great for 2 of us and the space is really clean and neat. We didn’t have a car and found it super easy to Uber most places outside the neighborhood. Thanks for a great stay!!",1.0
Chicago,"Loved Jim and Maximo’s place, it was very spacious, clean and stylish. I enjoyed looking through the magazines and the beds were extremely comfortable. The neighborhood is terrific, close enough to public transportation, cofffee shops, restaurants and not too far from the lake. Street parking was so easy, parked in front every time no matter what time of day. Thanks for an excellent experience for my family and me!",1.0
Chicago,"Jim’s place was (Website hidden by Airbnb) pictured and described...super cute, spacious, and comfy! Great neighborhood with access to awesome restaurants within walking distance, and easy ~12-15 min walk to red line to get into downtown. Our family also appreciated the local playgrounds and family vibe of the neighborhood. Jim and Maximo were wonderful hosts. They were quick to communicate with us and responsive to our needs. We would definitely stay again upon a return visit to Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"We really enjoyed staying at Jim's place over a quick weekend get-away to Chicago. It's very close to all the Andersonville shops and restaurants on Clark St. and a short walk to the el stop to go downtown; it's in a lovely, quiet, leafy neighborhood of brownstones. Parking was easy -- there was street parking right outside the apartment; we parked the car when we arrived Friday and didn't need to move it or use it until we left on Sunday. The apartment was very clean and well-appointed, with a great kitchen and nice amenities. Jim was there to give us the keys when we checked in; he and Maximo were available if needed but also gave us space. We'd highly recommend this one!",1.0
Chicago,"Stylish apartment in a great location with convenient parking and great restaurants/shops nearby. We really enjoyed our stay here. The kitchen had everything we needed to cook and prepare our own food. Jim was very responsive and accommodating, which made everything easy and enjoyable. I wish that we could have controlled the heat ourselves, but when the apartment started to get a bit chilly, we notified Jim, and he was able to turn on the heat for us quickly. Overall a great space and great experience!",1.0
Chicago,"Jim’s place is aesthetically pleasing, clean, and comfortable. It is in the lovely neighborhood of Andersonville and accessible to many restaurants and shops. I appreciated the clear communication, quick responses, ease of check in, and helpfulness when I needed to extend my stay. The house is well equipped with the conveniences and thoughtful touches that are helpful to a busy business traveler- a high quality iron and real ironing board, a washer and drier, toiletries, coffee etc.I would definitely stay at Jim’s place again.",1.0
Chicago,"We loved staying here! The place was beautiful, with many nice touches, a charming older building but remodelled with modern amenities, and sparkling clean. Getting in was very convenient, there were snacks left there for us to enjoy, parking on the street was easy, and Jim and Maximo always responded immediately to all of our queries, plus checked in to see if we wanted coffee, or needed anything else from them, checked on the comfort of the beds, and generally made sure that we had a great stay and felt well cared for. The kitchen is well appointed - the only thing not available was a microwave, but Maximo commented that he's about to get one for the apartment so that can be expected soon.  This is a great apartment with caring and involved hosts. I recommend staying here unconditionally!",1.0
Chicago,"The apartment was beautiful and very spacious. There are restaurants, grocery stores and pharmacies within walking distance. The neighborhood seemed very safe and we enjoyed walking around even in the cold weather. The Keurig and snack basket were nice touches which we appreciated. The beds were  too firm to be comfortable for me, but my boyfriend was fine with it, so it may be personal preference. Jim and Maximo were very attentive and always ready to help. Please note, the apartment does not have a microwave. Also, there is a policy that you cannot have any guest enter into the apartment (not just for sleeping, but for visiting too) which I misunderstood when booking, but it was not a problem since it was only the two of us. If you're traveling in a group or with family staying in other places, you may want to look for another place if you want them to be able to visit you. Overall our stay was lovely and we would recommend this apartment.",1.0
Chicago,"Location, location, location! The spot is located in a beautiful historic neighbourhood filled with lots of charm, great shops, and fantastic restaurants within walking distance. The space was incredibly clean, beautifully decorated, and had everything we needed for a great weekend. Jim was a great host and provided all the amenities we could have needed. 10/10 would stay here again!",1.0
Chicago,"This is a clean and beautifull apartment. Really clean and tidy, felt like home.  Close to coffee shops and general shops.  Jim and Maximo  checked up on me to make sure all my needs were meet and told me where the good coffee shops are. I highly recommend staying. I will deff come back in the future. 10/10 :)",1.0
Chicago,"This was my second stay at Ellie’s place, and I maintain that it’s one of the best Airbnbs ever! So quiet, clean, stylish, and comfortable. The tub is awesome and the coffee’s great, what more could I ask for?",1.0
Chicago,"Place was great! Clean, cozy, great location. Check in & out went seamlessly. LOVED the bathtub and shower. I would definitely recommend. The TV package was a surprising plus.. not usually one to hang out too much at a bnb- but after a day of drinking at Wrigley we were feeling a little rough-  it was so nice to just chill out the next day watching movies and ordering food! Loved it!",1.0
Chicago,"As a single traveler the studio set up was perfect for me. The location was great, since I had just been staying downtown at a conference prior to my stay it was nice to get out a bit and see some other neighborhoods. I could easily walk to the 606 Trail - which I really enjoyed - and N Milwaukee Ave for some fun shopping. I appreciated the guide they had in the studio with local recommendations listed, I got take-out from the Indian place down the street and it was delicious. Very comfortable bed!",1.0
Chicago,"Elinor went above and beyond to accommodate our stay, the level of hospitality was excellent!   The space is gorgeous and welcoming. I love that every detail was thought out, and this carries out throughout all the pieces in the home. Definitely a gem in the city.",1.0
Chicago,"Loved my stay here! Very comfortable bed, very clean, artistic space, thoughtful books and postcards, easy check in and out. Highly recommend staying here if you want to be in the Wicker Park area of Chicago!",1.0
Chicago,"I absolutely loved this place! I already told my sister that when we get the chance to go to Chicago together we will absolutely have to stay there. It was the perfect size and had everything I needed. The style of the whole place was gorgeous. I can tell a lot of thought went into creating this space. The shower and bathtub were amazing, and it was very helpful that there was a hair dryer, shampoo/conditioner, body wash, etc. When I do get the chance to travel to Chicago again I hope this is available. I can’t say enough about how much I loved this place!",1.0
Chicago,"From the incredibly easy check in and location, to the thoughtful touches that made us feel at home, to the impeccably curated style, we absolutely loved stayed here. It will be our go to any time we are back in Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"What can I say except that Elinor’s place was great! The little touches, such as welcome beers, pour over coffee, books on Chicago, and available toilet trees (we flew in and only had carry-one) were perfect. We only used the room for sleeping since we spent most of our day and night exploring the city! The weather is Chicago sure is unpredictable and crazy, so make sure you have a jacket or umbrella on stand by! Haha Thank you again for allowing us to stay in your lovely place!",1.0
Chicago,"We loved this place! It has all of the amenities and comfort of a nice hotel and more. The space was stunning, just like the photos. It felt very private which was great. We appreciated all of the books about Chicago and local restaurants. We’ll be back!",1.0
Chicago,This place is exactly as it looks! Super cute with personal touches so you know you’re getting an authentic experience. It’s close enough to the L to make traveling to and from the city accessible! Would for sure stay here again; wish I had more time :),1.0
Chicago,"OMG this place is so fantastic. It's PERFECT. I'm going to stay here again for sure! Great location, excellent host, so stylish and cool. The place also comes with an amazing little booklet to tell you how to use the WiFi and coffeemaker, and how to get around.",1.0
Chicago,"If I had more a sense of self-interest, I would write the  worst review ever so that this amazing space is always available for me when I'm in Chicago. First: it is it's own little building in the city. Wow! It's designed so beautifully, I took tons of photos to inspire my guest house back in CT. Elinor was responsive, accommodating, and super nice. I'm spreading the word to all of my friends who are jazzed staying there. The location is 10-12 minutes from downtown... well worth it for these gorgeous accommodations. BTW: the photos don't really capture the details and inviting sweetness of the place. I'll see you again, Elinor!",1.0
Chicago,"Ellie and Devin's space is charming! It's a well-designed, well-maintained large studio with incredibly thoughtful touches: books about the history of Chicago, more books from Chicago based writers and poets, games, postcards, and even stamps. I was a little nervous the first night with the studio being so close to the street, but I slept like a dream – the bed is comfortable and the studio is airy and bright. The place is exactly as pictured, even better. Ellie and Devin were very responsive and helpful. I would definitely come back and highly recommend staying here.",1.0
Chicago,This place is in the best part of the city! So easy to walk everywhere! It is clean with amazing amenities! The cute little touches! The great bath and shower! The delicious pour-over coffee! I want to stay there again.,1.0
Chicago,Elinor’s apartment is the perfect place for a cozy and stylish stay in Chicago. Everything we could’ve needed was provided and Elinor’s neighborhood recommendations were superb! I would highly recommend this place to anyone wanting to visit Chicago (and to avoid tourist traps)!,1.0
Chicago,"I can’t say it enough- this is THE best Airbnb I’ve ever stayed at and is so cozy! It’s worth every penny! I came to take my boards and it was just perfect for the stay. It’s so stylish, quaint, adorable neighborhood, and the little touches are unlimited! There was wine and beer stocked in the fridge, a cute pour over coffee pot and trader joe beans with a grinder! Basically I’m sad I can’t just move and stay in forever. People always say, “oh I’ll be back” but this is serious, I can’t wait to book again! I have best friends who live in the city and I’d still pay to stay in this awesome space! Airbnb MVP! Don’t hesitate! Book it now!",1.0
Chicago,"What you see on the photos are absolutely accurate and more! Loved the open space, high ceilings and obviously the bath. I've been using Airbnb for most of my travels and this is one of the nicest and most aesthetically pleasing location I have ever stayed at!",1.0
Chicago,"My fiancé and I were in town to celebrate our anniversary weekend. We couldn't have picked a better place to stay. The open layout, soft lighting, and claw foot tub all made it seem like a dream. Thank you so much!",1.0
Chicago,"Ellie was fantastic, super fast responses to my emails. Her place was fantastic, and right in the neighborhood where we needed to be. Hate to say this, but she could easily get more per night given the location and how awesome the space is.   Cheers!",1.0
Chicago,"Great place! Great host! We actually had major delays on our flight out of Chicago and she offered for us to stay another night. We felt loved and cared for. If you want a spot not in the downtown hustle but still in the city enough to Uber for good rates, look no further. Quiet neighborhood. Pictures described the space very accurately. It was the perfect space for a quick getaway to Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"Amazing and beautiful first airbnb experience. The place was decorated very modern and was clean. Both the walk in shower and claw-foot tub were great and the water got very hot. The bed was super comfy! There were plenty of towels, extra sheets, and blankets to use as well. There were also nice personal touches such as food recommendations and stocked beverages in the fridge (water filter, coffee, and some wine). Me and my boyfriend had an amazing time.",1.0
Chicago,"Wonderful place to stay while visiting the windy city of Chicago! Not far from great restaurant, bars, shopping and downtown. The coach house is decorated to perfection in mid-century modern decor and very clean. My husband and I used Uber all weekend and waiting no longer than 2 min. for a pickup at the house.  Highly recommend a stay at this location.",1.0
Chicago,"Great place to stay in Chicago. The space is very functionable and artsy, open and airy- we loved it. Comfy bed, all amenities you would want and then far more are provided. There are even beautiful post cards for you to write home with! Highly recommend it!",1.0
Chicago,Ellie’s place is exactly what you see in the all - no false advertising. It’s very light and open and she maximizes the space greatly. She’s very easy to communicate with. The Damen & Western L stations are close enough walk which we utilized a lot. Would definitely stay here again!,1.0
Chicago,"Gorgeous! I loved staying here. It was in a cool neighborhood and the studio was clean, styled well, and the bathroom was top notch. I want to stay here every time I come back to Chicago. They also have postcards and stamps for your use. Sweet little detail. Thanks so much!",1.0
Chicago,"This is a fantastic place. Super bright, extremely clean, great design, and extremely comfortable. Parking was easy. Check in and check out were super convenient and Elinor was very responsive. Can’t recommend highly enough!",1.0
Chicago,Eleanor's place was fantastic! Every detail was thought of including the courtesy postcards depicting her cat who sits in the window in the house on Artesian Street on the front. I would come back to Chicago just to hang out in this cool Studio for a weekend.,1.0
Chicago,"This is a gem of a space that is a close walk to some great cafes, shopping, and night life. As someone who travels a fair amount, I would say this was one of my favorite stays at an AirBNB. The space itself is very thoughtfully curated. ",1.0
Chicago,"There is a reason so many reviews start with how stylish the place is. That reason is because it is stunning and just as advertised! The level of detail and thought put in to the design is unbelievable.   Location is great, quick walk to the blue line. Check in/out is super easy, and the studio manual made our interactions minimal.   Great place to stay, will absolutely repeat.   Thanks again!",1.0
Chicago,"This place was great. It's worth the price just to swim around in that huge bathtub. Ellie was a great host, and the apartment had everything you could need for a great time in Chicago. I found most places I needed to go (food, cute shops, metro) to be about a ~10 min walk away, which I don't mind because I love to walk, but if you don't consider getting a car. It was really easy to get to downtown using the train. I have no complaints, this was an awesome  place!",1.0
Chicago,"This is such a cute, clean and comfortable space! I could stay here for weeks! Nice little neighborhood. Had initially worried about noise at night, but it did quiet down for a restful evening.  The fresh ground coffee, sodas, beer help to make it comfortable. Nice distance from downtown. Safe to run in the mornings with a park nearby. Love this place!",1.0
Chicago,"Ellie’s studio is absolutely stunning! She goes above & beyond for her guest! There are loads of local nicknacks laying around the studio to indulge into. She has her cabinets stocked with things one might need (ibuprofen, cotton swabs, razors, etc). The neighbor hood is very nice. There are not many of taxi’s in the area, so if you don’t drive one might want to download uber. Definitely worth the stay! Would definitely come back!",1.0
Chicago,"Fantastic stay! The studio was as pristine as pictured. You felt more like you were staying in a hotel than someone's home. Great amenities like shampoo, soft towels and even yoga mats! Would highly recommend,",1.0
Chicago,"Elinor's studio was a magical place, and I could tell as I soon as I stepped up to the door, because care was taken in styling the exterior with little faerie lights that sparkled. I hate to say this, but I can be a bit of snob when it comes aesthetic and decor. I have not one complaint about this studio. I was absolutely blown away. The incredible level of detail and design, even down to the studio's handbook was meticulous and thought out.  What's even more wonderful is the central location to all the haunts in the Bucktown/Wicker Park area. I drove and literally everywhere I went was less than a 10 minutes away. I can't imagine that taking public transportation would take any longer. If you do drive, Elinor provides a parking permit, which gives you the freedom to park anywhere in the vivinity without the fear of getting a ticket.  By far Elinor's place is one of the best spots I've stayed in for Air BnB. If you're looking for something magical and romantic (oh, I forgot to mention there's wonderfully restored claw-foot Victorian bath tub) look no further.",1.0
Chicago,Stayed here while visiting Chicago. The apartment was really clean and cozy and located in a really good location for our trip. We were able to park right out front for our stay and walk everywhere. If you're looking to spend time in the Ukrainian Village i would recommend staying here. Close to the train if ya want to travel other places too.,1.0
Chicago,"The initial observation of the space was of course a stylish space for a reasonable price.  Seeing the space in person is such an enjoyable experience - especially when noticing all the fine details not revealed in the online pics.  It is in those details that raises the level of impression and sets it apart from other spaces.    Elinor and I had minimal contact, but that was because instructions were clear on the check-in and check-out procedures, where to park, and even how to make the coffee - which we were thoroughly confused at first.    I enjoy exploring different places to stay when visiting areas, but I would consider staying here again on my next trip to Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"I enjoyed my stay at Elinor's studio apartment in Wicker Park.  The location was pefect for me.  The studio was quite stylish and had many personal touches, including a studio manual which I found quite helpful and fun.  I really appreciated the 2 bottles of wine and the beer selection in the fridge.  The kitchen was minimal but that was fine with me because I planned to enjoy Chicago's dining scene.  The bed was  very confortable, which was a definite plus.  The heater was somewhat louder than I was expecting, but that is the only concern I had.  I would definitely stay here again.",1.0
Chicago,"This is a great spot. Located near hip Wicker Park and related. Quiet, good access to Metro and very pleasant spot to hang out and do some work too. Hostess was very helpful on restaurants etc . This is a top BnB!!!",1.0
Chicago,"The space is exactly as described. Gorgeous. The bathroom is stylish, clean, and the shower is great. Would love to have a space like that in my own home tbh. They have cute touches throughout the studio, including Where Chefs Eat (I have that at home too!) and Studs Terkel's ""Working"" in the bathroom. The bed was really comfortable and once we figured out how to configure the NEST properly for our purposes, the temperature control was on point. One minor note is that both heat and cool air come out predominantly at the head of the bed, and it could be bothersome to people who are sensitive to dry air. My wife had to turn to the foot of the bed one night because she's super sensitive, but it didn't bother me much. The location was good for me because I don't need to be right downtown and don't mind taking a Lyft everywhere, plus I like to be in ""real"" neighborhoods. Puerto Rican restaurants abound as well as cool street art, if you care to venture around. It's about a twenty minute drive to many downtown area attractions. The hosts were very accommodating to my needs, as I had to cancel one day due to a family emergency. They were very easy to work with throughout. Will definitely look to return here my next stay in Chicago",1.0
Chicago,Elinor's place is close to perfect. Every corner of the space is thoughtfully detailed and styled. It's located very centrally to Logan Square and the Bucktown/Wicker Park area and I enjoyed walking the neighborhood in my downtime. Her communication was clear and extremely quick and I truly cannot say enough about how pleasant my stay was. Highly recommended.,1.0
Chicago,"Before I arrived, I loved the photos and thought the place would be perfect for my stay over New Year's. Walking in, it was somehow even better. From the furniture to the lighting to the tableware, everything in the space is very intentionally curated. I have a feeling the owners are designers; the whole place has a great aesthetic while still being comfortable. One of my favorite places I've stayed so far",1.0
Chicago,"We had a great stay at this charming, stylish studio. Clean digs and thoughtful touches like coffee, beer, and wine were lovely. Location was perfect for getting around town by foot or Lyft, yet the street itself was quiet and residential. Great host communication and simple check in and check out. Would stay again in a heartbeat!",1.0
Chicago,"I love this spot . The layout, decor and vibe are definitely hip. Everything is so easy + the communication with Elinor is on point. The amenities are great . The experience is very hommie , every time you discover little details that make a difference in your stay.   If you’re looking for something local, not loud ,  away from tourists this is definitely a good location.",1.0
Chicago,"Ellie’s place is so so wonderful! Chic, stylish, beautiful location from which you can easily access the trendiest Chicago area, Wicker Park. Ellie responds in mere minutes should you need anything and the keypad entry makes it so easy to come and go as you please, no need for keys! 10/10 would recommend and hope to stay here again! ❤️",1.0
Chicago,"Beautiful decor with so much space! Instructions for checkin were easy to follow. The coffee and extras were great!  Very comfortable bed! The apartment has an urban ambiance. Jeremy provided parking passes and we were able to find parking a block away. Communication was excellent. Jeremy answered any questions I had almost immediately. Neighborhood had a safe feel. We walked to local restaurants close by. One unfortunate thing, which was no fault of our host- when we went to leave, we discoveredthat our catalytic converter was stolen off of our car. I had driven our older SUV since I knew it would be parked for several days. Turns out, these are easiervehicles to get under and cut. I would not hesitate to stay here again.",1.0
Chicago,"This Airbnb is the best! Location and space are the key highlights! Jeremy has great design taste! Close to the train and many restaurants. We would definitely stay here again! If you’re visiting, try the rolled ice cream across the street! We had it twice!",1.0
Chicago,"The apartment was absolutely fantastic and everything was as good as advertised. The entire unit was much more spacious than it appeared in the photos which was a welcomed surprise as I have stayed in several Airbnb's that were smaller than photographed.   You could not ask for a better location, one block from the blue line which made traveling to/from O'Hare and into downtown a breeze. You're also within walking distance to countless top notch restaurants and shops.  Jeremy was a very responsive and accommodating host and he really made us feel taken care of when we had some flight plan changes. I would recommend this apartment to anyone wanting to visit Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"There is much to like about this apartment.  It's spacious, has full amenities, plenty of character, parking is included, and the place is clean.  Wicker Park is growing, has a unique vibe, feels safe, and offers options within walking distance for groceries.  The area also has many choices for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and drinks.  We chose to use the kitchen for breakfast, and the waffle maker was a great perk.  A critical factor in comfort, rest and relaxation is the bed.  While clean, we found the mattress to be uncomfortable.  It currently presents itself as firm and lumpy with indentations and sag from years of use.  Upgrading this one very important item would make this location, apartment, and experience worth renting again.  We enjoyed our stay overall and will keep this as an option in the future.",1.0
Chicago,"Came to Chicago for my cousin's birthday party. It was in my old neighborhood, so I felt very much at home. The place was spacious and exactly how it was described! I briefly meet Jeremy when I arrived, he was extremely nice. Would love to come back here when I visit Chicago again.",1.0
Chicago,"I loved this loft and everything about it.  The location was great - 1.5 blocks from the CTA - we were able to explore the entire city using public transportation.  Check in and check out were a breeze.  Jeremy was kind and offered great suggestions when we met briefly during the stay.  The apartment was spotlessly clean, comfortable, quiet and well appointed.  This was my first visit to Chicago and I would gladly stay here on my next trip.",1.0
Chicago,"We loved this place. It's spacious and very convenient. If you have small children, you may want to know that there is a firehouse nearby, but it did not bother us, we expected city noises. There's a Metro station barely a block away. It's great to have a washer and dryer right in the apartment since we tend to pack very lightly. We greatly appreciated the neighborhood parking stickers Jeremey provided and we easily found parking about 1 block away on a safe, residential street. We'll stay here again next time we're in town.",1.0
Chicago,"This is a large, 1 bedroom apartment within 2 blocks of the blue line. Very convenient! There’s a well equipped full kitchen with a small grocery across the street. Of course there a numerous great restaurants in the area so there’s no need to cook. The apartment was very comfortable and clean. We had plenty of pillows, blankets, towels etc. which was much appreciated.",1.0
Chicago,"This was my very first AirBnB and if all of them are like this one, I'll never stay in a hotel again. Jeremey's communication was excellent from start to finish and his home is so beautiful and immaculate. It is easy to find and right off the blue line. The home had EVERYTHING I needed and then some. He even left me 2 day parking passes for the area which made people coming by easy to park nearby. It is in a very cool neighborhood and as a single woman staying in an area I've never been, I felt very safe. When I visit again, I would definitely stay there again.",1.0
Chicago,Jeremey is a wonderful host and his place is extremely nice. He is quick to respond with any questions and is willing to give recommendations around the city. The place was clean and decorated with care. It has everything you would need during your stay.,1.0
Chicago,"Jeremy's apartment is exactly as advertised - stylish, large, comfortable and spotlessly clean in a very safe, hip neighborhood.  The kitchen has all you would need to fix your own meals.  We, however, opted to take advantage of the multitude of excellent bars, coffee shops and restaurants within very easy walking distance on Division Street and North Milwaukee Avenue (for lovers of high quality Nepalese / Indian food we recommend Cumin on North Milwaukee). Communication with Jeremy was very easy.  If and when we return to this part of Chicago Wicker we would, without hesitation choose to stay in Jeremy's place.",1.0
Chicago,"We were very pleased with the apartment. With an updated modern kitchen and bathroom we had everything we needed to be comfortable. Jeremy was a great host, communicated all details we needed when needed.",1.0
Chicago,Jeremy's place was fantastic! It is really big. Was great to unpack and have space and feel at home. Really close to the blue line. Easy to get anywhere. Felt safe in the neighborhood. Fire station next door but never bothered us or woke us up. Would definitely stay again!,1.0
Chicago,Our stay was great! Jeremey was very responsive when we asked him about accommodating our two dogs during the stay. There was even a small crate provided that we ended up using for the smaller pup. Everything was just as described and the apartment is close to many great restaurants and shops. We'd stay again! :),1.0
Chicago,"Jeremey's place is fantastic -- it's bigger than we were expecting and has a really nice overall feel to it.  It's nicely decorated and has all the amenities you would need.  Jeremey was very quick to respond to messages and helped out if anything at all was needed.  Check-in was simple and the building felt secure.  It's just a couple minutes' walk to the blue line, which brings you right into downtown in about 10 minutes.  Also close to some cool spots on N Milwaukee, like Oiistar, the amazing ramen place.  Super nice experience and we'd definitely stay with Jeremey again!",1.0
Chicago,"This was perfect for our needs.  Everything was as advertised.  It's a beautiful space and the location is great.  (Ashland itself is not too appealing but you're a one-minute walk from blue line, can stroll west on Division or walk up Milwaukee Ave to Bucktown.).  Self-checkin was super easy and we had everything we needed.",1.0
Chicago,"Jeremy was very responsive, answering all questions quickly and thoroughly.  His place was nice and very clean.  My parents stayed at the Air BnB to visit me and were quite pleased.  Being that I own and live in downtown Chicago, I can say that this location fantastic and the price to be a great value.",1.0
Chicago,This place is one of the nicest accommodations I have ever stayed at. Yes the price is expensive compared to a hotel but if you want a solid night's sleep and little slice of home be sure to check out Jeremy's place!,1.0
Chicago,Wonderful place.  We really enjoyed ourselves and relaxed at Jeremey's loft.  Very clean.  We enjoyed being able to watch people on the streets from the loft.  Love the mixture of cultures which we don't get much of back home.  Location was great.  Very quick walk to get to Wicker Park and many great local restaurants as well.  Felt very safe in the neighborhood and at Jeremey's place.  Super nice people.  Jeremey is fantastic at returning messages.  Always a quick reply and we had no problems at all that couldn't be fixed quickly.  Highly recommend Jeremey's loft!,1.0
Chicago,"Jeremey's apartment far exceeded our expectations.  The pictures don't do justice to how beautiful, stylish and very spacious this place is, not to mention comfortable and clean.  Everything was simply perfect.  Every possible amenity to make you feel right at home--we wanted for nothing.  Comfortable bed and couches, beautiful, roomy bathroom with large shower and plenty of hot water, fully stocked kitchen, excellent wi-fi and incredibly easy check-in process. We loved the location, merely 2 short blocks (roughly 3 min) walk to the Blue line on the L/ subway.  So easy to get to the main attractions downtown, but also in a great spot to explore the Wicker Park/ West Town neighborhoods and all the great restaurants and shops.  An excellent Airbnb experience--Thank you, Jeremey!!",1.0
Chicago,We found it exactly as advertised—perhaps even better. Super accommodations in a great location. Jeremey was very accessible and promptly responded to our requests and questions. We look forward to staying there again on our next trip to Chicago.,1.0
Chicago,We LOVED the location. The area seemed very safe and was central to the blue line and a Divvy bike station. (Tip: take the blue line to and from O’hare to save a lot of money on transportation) The apartment was very roomy and we enjoyed having access to a kitchen. Something to note is the TV does not have cable or “smart” access. We ended up buying a firestick so we had something to watch while winding down at the end of our days. Jeremy was quick to respond any time we had questions or needed anything! Thank you for a great stay!,1.0
Chicago,"Better than it looked online, a beautiful space with everything needed and then some. Great location, close to public transportation and wonderful local spots. Jeremy was attentive and helpful with all of my queries. Would stay here whenever I’m in Chicago. Can’t recom enough!",1.0
Chicago,"This is a beautiful unit in a great neighborhood in Chicago.  Jeremy was a great host and was easy to communicate with.  Check-in and check-out were a breeze and the apartment was spotless.  It's on a busy street but there was very little noise.  The blue line is a block away as are Target, CVS and a bunch of great coffee shops and places to eat.  Also super easy to pick up a cab or an Uber/Lyft.  Would recommend this place without hesitation!",1.0
Chicago,Communication was fast and easy and Jeremey was available every step of the way.    Apartment was better than I expected.  Great location and very close to the Blue Line which can get you just about anywhere.     Would absolutely recommend and would stay here again in the future.   ,1.0
Chicago,"This is a spacious apartment and very nicely furnished. The location is just a few minutes walk from the blue line with quick transportation direct to the heart of downtown. Check-in was easy and the host provided a sheet with lots of helpful suggestions for local eating places, of which there are many.  Staying at Jeremey's place for 4 nights provided a very comfortable place to stay for our tired bodies after spending our days exploring Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,Jeremey’s place is very spacious and clean.  It has everything you need for a short or long term stay.  Jeremey is very nice and answers any question very promptly.  The location is also very convenient for travel on public transport.  Highly recommended!,1.0
Chicago,"Couldn't have asked for a better place. It was super easy to get to and from both town and O'Hare, with a Blue Line stop only one block away. It was beautiful and cheerful as well. Loved the full kitchen and nice extra-large tub. Jeremey was a lovely host. I wish we could have stayed even longer!",1.0
Chicago,"Great location with convenient transportation. The neighborhood has a cool vibe. As a vinyl record collector, I was excited about being across the street from Dusty Groove and close to Reckless Records. Great overall experience.",1.0
Chicago,"My wife and I spent 2 nights at Jeremey's place. While pictures can often be deceiving, we were pleasantly surprised at how large and open the apartment was in person. It was perfect. Jeremey was traveling in Spain at the time, but he was quick to respond to questions we had the day of and during the trip about things such as checking in and adjusting the nest thermostat. We'd happily stay there again.",1.0
Chicago,Great space in a convenient location—a vibrant neighborhood and just a block from blue line. The apartment has a good vibe and personality and is very clean. Jeremy was attentive and responsive. I’ll go back.,1.0
Chicago,"Jeremey's apartment is really great. It's large and bright in all the right places (and quieter and darker in the bedroom, which is lovely for sleeping), stylishly decorated (without being overdone--the decor fits the urban space perfectly), has a fantastic shower, everything you need for a comfortable stay and is in one of my favorite Chicago neighborhoods, with a bajiggety restaurants, bars, shops, etc. The provided parking passes are super helpful, especially for weekend stays, because parking in this part of the city is no joke (in fact, if you can manage without a car, do, because you won't need it once you're here--everything is walkable, lyft/uber is plentiful and the El train is literally right there.)  If mobility is an issue for you, you should know that you have to walk up a flight of steep, narrow stairs to get to the apartment. Also, it's really in the real city, and real cities generally aren't that quiet, so if you're a super sensitive sleeper who needs deep, dark silence, you'll maybe want to bring ear plugs and/or a sleep mask.   But otherwise, I completely recommend this place. Jeremey is a kind, helpful and responsive host, the apartment is so lovely, and it's a really great value for Chicago, too.",1.0
Chicago,"We enjoyed our stay at Jeremy’s place. It's conveniently located, about 15 minutes to the loop and 20 minutes to Midway airport. Although we got around with Uber, the blue line is just minutes across the street. The apartment is super clean and lovely decorated. Jeremy is very thoughtful with the travel guide and tips. It was great to meet a Cal alumni at Chicago. =) I would recommend this listing to everyone.",1.0
Chicago,"This home was great. Jeremey provided easy check in details and instructions. The location was great because I was close to everything downtown and many shops and stores. I recommend this home and would certainly stay here again. Thanks again, Jeremey!",1.0
Chicago,"Jeremy was easily accessible for any questions via text and he even checked in the second day to make sure everything was okay. The apartment spacious, comfortable and centrally located. Just a few steps to the blue line CTA train, restaurants and shops. The neighborhood is busy so the provided parking permits were a huge plus.",1.0
Chicago,"This space is amazing. Plenty of room, furnishings are great, kitchen has everything you could need, and the shower was perfect after a long day of exploring Chicago in the cold. Jeremey was prompt with responses and great about giving me tips on places to check out. Literally just a few steps away from the Blue Line which made getting around the city super easy. I will definitely be looking to get this place again next time I am in Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"Great place! We stayed there with our 18month during our summer holiday trip, all three of us loved Jeremey’s place. Bigger than expected. Jeremey was very supportive and fast with all kind of questions. We can highly recommend this place, also when you are traveling with small children.",1.0
Chicago,"What a great stay in Chicago!!! Jeremey‘s loft is perfectly situated in one of our favourite areas within Chicago. There are so many things to explore in walking distance: restaurants, shopping, parks, and the great 606 trail. The train („L“, blue line) - which is more or less directly in front of the apartment - connects you directly with downtown as well as with the airport. The apartment is so cool, we would love to live there! Despite the busy street in front of the house the apartments inside is so quiet and we slept like babies. Jeremey is a fantastic host and helped us a lot to find our ways, gave us great recommendations and answered immediately whenever we wrote a message. We will definitely come again!!!",1.0
Chicago,"A very spacious and spotlessly clean apartment, it holds special charm with bare brick walls and wooden floors with plenty of seating and a very large bed with a well equipped dressing room.  The bathroom is great with a very impressive bath for easing away the muscles after a long day of exploring.  We didn’t use the kitchen much apart from making a hot drink as we ate out most of the time but there is a great health food shop just opposite and a food shop just by the subway station.  Although we didn’t get to meet Jeremey his communication with us was superb.",1.0
Chicago,"Jeremy’s place is amazing, not only is it huge, it has everything you need for a comfortable stay, it’s in a great location for getting around town (literally one minute walk from the blue line at Division), and really easy to get to on the blue line from O’hare airport.  Jeremy was a fantastic host, very quick to respond to any queries we had, and was kind enough to let us leave our bags for a couple of hours while we went for brunch before heading back to the airport.  I would highly recommend his apartment to anyone wanting to explore Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,We had a very nice stay at Jeremy’s Airbnb. Lots of space and a big kitchen. Jeremy responds quickly to questions and everything went very smooth. It is in a good location if you want to explore Wicker Park.,1.0
Chicago,"Really enjoyed spending a few days in Jeremey's place. Great location with Intelligentsia across the road, as well as La Pasadita and a good grocery store too. Warm, clean and cosy. Would definitely return.",1.0

Chicago,"This is a beautiful apartment, so wonderfully kept! Jeremy was a wonderful host and despite the fact that we had a mx up during checkout, he was patient and kind and just te consummate host. The apartment is wonderful, the area is well connected and I would stay here again In a heartbeat. ",1.0
Chicago,"Jeremey’s place is so beautiful, a perfect loft you could imagine with a view to a quiet street. It has lots of light, in the morning or in the evening too. Subway is 1 minute walking distance (literally)! Fire station in the adjacent building is not bothering at all, they turned out to be the most quiet neighbors we ever had :) Many thanks to Jeremey, we would like to return!",1.0
Chicago,Beautiful apartment thats is decorated to perfection. Its conveniently located (10 min walk to wicker park and 20 min subway to downtown). Jeremy was very accommodating and his local coffee & donut tips were great!,1.0
Chicago,"Rob’s place was beautiful! It looked exactly as advertised. The apartment was spacious & stylishly decorated. Lots of restaurants & bars within walking distance, as well as a grocery store. Rob was super responsive & hospitable. We were not able to check in before 3, but he allowed us to leave our luggage in his store prior to check in & even took it upstairs to the apartment for us! The only downside was that the bedroom can get a little warm, especially on a hot summer day. Other than that, we fully enjoyed our stay. Would definitely stay here again!",1.0
Chicago,"Rob’s Place was beautifully furnished and decorated. It was also only a 3 minute walk from the nearest bus stop which can take you to downtown or any of the metro/L lines - very convenient. The only downside is that there is no air conditioning in the bedroom so it got really hot. It is also on the 3rd floor so that’s something to consider if you don’t like taking the stairs. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and would recommend it!",1.0
Chicago,Rob's place is immaculate! I have never seen an Airbnb so tastefully decorated and cozy. Its in the middle of a bustling restaurant and shopping district but is surprisingly quiet. Rob himself was very responsive and a great host. I would definitely come back here for sure. Make sure you take advantage of the $20/day parking that Rob offers. It was a lifesaver.,1.0
Chicago,"My experience could not have been better. This was the mog immaculate, stylish, modern, and comfortable AirBnB experience I've ever had. The owner has spared no expense, from stainless steel alliances to remodeled bathrooms and showers, to new wood flooring. The temper-pedic bed was heavenly, and the furnishings were modern and comfortable. The attention to detail was unparalleled, from train maps and restaurant guides to Chicago artwork and plenty of cooking utensils and supplies, as well as beauty and hygiene products. I was beyond impressed with the level of care and consideration.   When I return to Chicago in the future, this will be my first choice. Always.",1.0
Chicago,We were In Chicago to see Hamilton and sightsee with our teenaged daughter. We loved this location and neighborhood. It felt safe and there were tons of nearby places to eat or get groceries. The condo itself was extremely clean and was well stocked with necessities. It was spacious and we never felt crowded. Rob was a great host and was very responsive to our questions. It was a plus to have  parking available as we never moved our car until we left Chicago. I would definitely rent from Rob again,1.0
Chicago,"Rob's place is incredibly stylish, supremely located, and overall provides a comfortable, beautiful perch from which to explore the city of Chicago.  As a host, Rob was incredibly hospitable and communicative, and was very helpful in getting me situated for the stay.  I highly recommend the apartment and would definitely stay here again!",1.0
Chicago,"This place is a fantastic stay!  Everything is wonderfully decorated, well thought-out, very clean, and it has an authenticity you can only find in a beautiful historic building.  The location is great as well. It’s a 13 minute drive to downtown Chicago, and 500 feet from the best breakfast place in town “Whisk”. You must go there!  Only thing missing in the Airbnb was coffee, so you may want to bring your own. But they have multiple ways to make it if you do.  Great stay, highly recommend this Airbnb!",1.0
Chicago,My wife and I came in to Chicago for our wedding anniversary and are so glad we chose to stay with Rob.  Probably the best Airbnb experience we’ve had.  He really thinks of everything and we can’t recommend staying here enough.,1.0
Chicago,Rob’ s space is 5 stars & beyond. He has gone the extra steps to make his guests well informed about the neighborhood & totally took care of everything you need to be comfortable away from your home. This Airbnb is the cleanest place we have ever stayed in.!!! You feel like you are his VERY FIRST guests! The photos give you a glimpse of the home but it out shines even those. Very modern & well appointed decor. His Christmas decorations were beautiful. He is warm & personable & communcation is outstanding. You will not be disappointed in your stay at Rob’s home!!!!,1.0
Chicago,"By far-this Rob's place is the most STUNNING home my husband and I stayed in. The décor is stylish, modern and pure class. The Holiday decorations made it festive and cozy. I really want those flocked trees!! LOL Absolutely gorgeous. The pictures of this listing does it NO JUSTICE!! Rob is a delight and one of thee most gracious hosts I have encountered. His level of hospitality is unparalleled and he gave us some great suggestions of local eateries in the area. His home is in great proximity to downtown and other neighborhoods. We truly could not be more pleased and dreaded leaving to return back to our home state. However, we will certainly be back and definitely in the process of making plans to book Rob's home again. You will not be disappointed!! Truly his home is a GEM!!!",1.0
Chicago,"The warmest home we've ever been in. Sparkling clean, modern and superb interior design, great location and a very lovely, warm host. Thank you, Rob and we promise to only stay at your place whenever we're in Chicago! An experience to remember!",1.0
Chicago,"This was the cleanest Airbnb we’ve ever stayed in. If you are picky with finding a clean place that actually FEELS clean, this home is for you. You can immediately tell that Rob takes pride in his apartment and everything is so well maintained and stylishly decorated. The bed was a welcomed place for rest after a long day, and we loved how firm the mattress was and how fluffy the pillows were—very comfortable.  The amenities were spot on, the coffeemaker, the gas stove, plenty of dishes and quality cookware to use for making a meal. Not mention, the exceptional decor of the entire apartment! The location was excellent and walkable to numerous local restaurants and bars (a few were literally steps from the apartment door). We loved being on the third floor and always felt super safe. There is some traffic noise that can be heard in the bedroom, but Rob provides earplugs for light sleepers. In truth, we actually enjoyed being lulled to sleep by the sounds of the city and it didn’t bother us at all. The convenience of the grocery store being a 5 minute walk away made buying some pantry and fridge essentials easy. The couch in the living room was super comfy and perfect for relaxing and watching the Thanksgiving Day parade and some Netflix Christmas movies. This was the perfect Airbnb and we were highly impressed (not always easy). 5 stars to Rob for such an amazingly clean, comfortable, stylish, and well thought out home away from home. We’ll be back soon!",1.0
Chicago,"This place is so much nicer in person! And wow the bed was so comfortable we ended up sleeping the first night we got there instead of going out because we got trapped in the bed lol. Communicating with Rob was very easy and his home was supplied with everything!! First aid kit, make up remover wipes you name it lol. The home is in a very quiet and safe neighborhood. Would definitely stay again, one of the nicest places I have ever stayed!",1.0
Chicago,"We had a short but wonderful stay at Rob's place for a weekend trip to Chicago. Communication and check-in were quick and easy, and it was a breeze to get there from the airport on the train and a bus.  The space was spotlessly clean and beautifully furnished, with thoughtful touches that made our stay really comfortable. The location is great too, with a grocery store nearby and lots of good food/drink options as well.  Our only regrets are that we didn't stay here longer to enjoy it more and that we had to catch a Sunday morning flight before we could peruse the beautiful store downstairs some more. We would definitely stay here again, and will happily recommend it to any family and friends who may be looking for a place to stay in Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"Rob’s apartment was exactly what we need for a wonderful stay in Chicago. It was styled beautifully and Rob provided everything we could possibly need- thought of everything! Only note to future guests is that it is on the third floor, so keep this mind when packing large luggage. I would highly recommend Rob and his apartment!",1.0
Chicago,"Rob’s place is one of the nicest, best located, and real value of all the places we have stayed!  It is tastefully furnished, very clean, modern, and had everything we needed to feel at home, including a fully-equipped kitchen.  Conveniently located to all the sites we wanted to see.  Also, close to a supermarket which was handy, and few steps to dozens of restaurants and cafes.  Rob was always quick to respond to my questions.  We highly recommend this wonderful apartment!  Looking forward to staying here next time we visit Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"The best place I’ve ever stayed at! Decorated to the 9s, home included everything I never even thought of - including band aids and bath salts for a lovely soak!

I will most certainly stay here again.",1.0
Chicago,"This might be my favorite Airbnb stay to date. The apartment so stunning, clean, and comfortable and charming Ukrainian Village with so much to offer, we chose to make fewer trips into the heart of the city to spend more time enjoying and exploring the immediate surroundings both in and out of the apartment. Yoga, restaurants, shops, grocery...everything within walking distance and this little oasis to temporarily call home. Rob couldn’t have been a better host. Will be back for sure!",1.0
Chicago,Rob’s place was amazing. Right in the center of everything. The location was close to many restaurants and bars. It is also a short ride to surrounding neighborhoods and downtown. The place itself was amazing with all the amenities needed for a great stay. Rob was prompt in his communication and was right below if needed. The parking space was a bonus as it is hard to find parking in this neighborhood without a permit.,1.0
Chicago,"Location, atmosphere, beautiful decor, every thought to amenities (even a First Aid Kit!)... you simply can't go wrong with this great condo in Ukrainian Village.  It was a snowy weekend so we especially enjoyed the cabinet full of games!  We were visiting family in Streeterville and getting there was no problem at all.  Rob greeted us when I arrived, and check-out was very simple.  Also, my brother drove over from a neighboring city to meet me, so we appreciated the off-street parking for him and his daughter.  Stay with Rob!  You won't regret it.",1.0
Chicago,"This is a stylish, modern yet comfortable apartment located in a cool part of town with lots of options to dine and a young at heart hip vibe.  I felt like a movie star in the surroundings & was happy to find out that the amazing shop below actually sold some of the items that are featured in the living space. It is located on an active street on the 3rd floor of a recently enovated building.  Rob is extremely responsive and a caring host.  I look forward to staying there again!",1.0

Super helpful with us as we learned to navigate city, food and parking. Being from a rural area, we were grateful to have the help! Maps on fridge. Nice residential area, felt safe even at night. Extremely clean. Special touches such as video games and snacks. Went above and beyond to provide a welcoming and safe environment. Room was stylized, modern. Plenty of amenities, even access to laundry. If we make our way back to town, we’ll stay here again. Thank you for making our first AirBNB memorable!",1.0
Chicago,"Great place to stay! Very clean and convenient to food and shops! Reminded me of being Ina little apartment. The shower was a bit small, so if you're a larger person it may be difficult to fit. But it was a very nice place and the host were quick to respond.",1.0

The decor is fantastic and we loved many of the little touches including the board games, tasteful art, game systems, and the water and drinks in the fridge were a welcome surprise after our evening arrival. Having central heat as well as a space heater in the unit helped make sure we stayed nice and toasty during our visit. We didn't take advantage of them, but the fact that a washer and dryer were available was a nice bonus.   We'll definitely look here first on our next trip to Chicago!",1.0

Chicago,"What a gem! Christopher’s place was exactly as described including a ton of extras. Christopher was quick to respond before and during my stay. He left a light on for me the night I arrived since I had a super late flight. He even checked in on me the next day to make sure I had everything I needed. The place was totally spotless. The bed was very comfy and there were tons of extra pillows. The kitchen was fully equipped and he even stocked it with several quick food items. These were much appreciated especially the first morning. The space felt so much more roomy than I was expecting. Ceilings are a bit lower being a garden unit but I had no problem at all with it. The water pressure in the shower was really great. Christopher made a really detailed welcome guide with lots of great info abt the neighborhood. The studio is only 3 short blocks away from a bus that takes you directly to the belmont el station (abt a 20-30 min ride). I felt very safe in the neighborhood (family vibe) even when coming in using transit late at night by myself. If you are wanting to do a lot of things in the Loop, transit took me 45-hour sometimes depending on the time of day. This was not a big deal for me bc I wanted a neighborhood experience vs more of a downtown touristy one, but it did take longer to get to and from. Lastly, Christopher was kind enough to  hold my luggage for me on my last day since I had a later flight. All in all, fantastic experience and I highly recommend this listing. Thank you so much, Christopher!",1.0

Above and beyond amenities, plenty of towels, pillows, even snacks and basic kitchen supplies!   I would be so happy to stay here again.",1.0

Transportation was nearby and made our rides to the city very convinient, also we got to explore more of it by using transportation.

Chicago,"We found this to be a much better alternative to expensive hotels. This apartment was private, quiet, and clean. Parking on the street was easy. Chris was very helpful and communicative. The water in the fridge was appreciated! We only stayed one night, but this place has everything you'd need for an extended stay. ",1.0
Chicago,Chris was an amazing host.  His place was very clean and better than we expected.  This was the wife’s first time visiting Chicago and she wasn’t disappointed as this place offers a lot of space for two guests.  Parking on the same street was hit and miss but that can be expected for a big city.  We took Lyft anytime we were visiting downtown Chicago.  It was nice to come and go as we pleased.  Chris responded very quickly to any messages that were sent.  I felt safe enough walking in the general neighborhood.  When we visit Chicago again this would definitely be the first choice.  Our first host cancelled which brought us to finding this gem.,1.0
Chicago,Could not have asked for a better space and location.  Outstanding customer service and friendliness from Chris.  Plus the money we spent even with Uber was less than half the cost of a hotel.  If I could give more than 5 stars I would.,1.0
Chicago,"Chris was a great host.  Nice touches like beverages and snacks in the fridge, full compliment of toiletries, etc.  Bed was firm and super comfortable for a convertible type sofa.  Not at all like a typical pull out bed.  I slept great.  Parking on the street was not a problem and the neighborhood felt super safe.  His place is a couple of miles from my daughter and definitely more convenient, comfortable, and affordable than any nearby hotel.",1.0
Chicago,"Christopher's place is great! It was very clean and comfortable. Check in was easy and Christopher was very easy to get in touch with.

Chicago,"Chris was very accommodating and went above and beyond. There were some basic foods in the fridge, fruit, eggs, soda, and pancake mix. He also held our bags for us on our last day and let us pick them up one the way out. Very nice guy and was always on top of things.",1.0
Chicago,"I can't give Christopher enough praise! This was absolutely perfect for our first trip to Chicago and the basement studio was just wonderful! Not only was it incredibly clean, stocked with snacks and home-y touches, but it was very comfortable and Christopher was an amazing host. He was very open to helping us with our bags when we were a little early to check in and he held them for us so we could go explore the city and enjoy our visit. He was great at communicating with us in a professional and timely manner, and his place was extremely clean and organized. We really made the right decision by staying here! We hope to come back to the area and we will be looking to stay here again! I would recommend to anyone coming to the area! ",1.0

My husband and I were in town to sight-see and were on the move most of the time but we were so thankful to have such convenient and comfortable accommodations at the end of a long day.

I’ll definitely be coming back!",1.0

Chicago,"Chris' place is really lovely! Plenty of space for 2 people, with lots of thoughtful touches like biscuits, bottled water, tea and coffee etc! The kitchen was well equipped to make meals, and Chris quickly provided a can opener when we asked to borrow one. The washer and dryer in the apartment were also very handy. Good location in a residential neighbourhood, about 10-15 min walk to the local Aldi and 10 mins to shops, including the currency exchange to get bus tickets. 5 mins walk from the bus stop that takes you to the blue line, which then takes you to O'hare airport or downtown. It takes around an hour to get to the Museum campus, and about 45 mins to attractions like the Skydeck and Hancock Tower. Chris recommended an architecture boat tour which was fab. Communication was always fast and helpful, would definitely recommend!",1.0
Chicago,Samantha and Jonathan were excellent hosts !! They made my stay in Chicago extremely comfortable. The unit was very clean and fully stocked with everything you would need.

Chicago,"Samantha’s place was perfect for our short stay! It was very clean, stylish and cozy. The small, secluded patio was a sweet surprise. Only things to note- the stairs are very steep and the neighbors have a puppy, which was loud when we came in after a concert during quiet hours. Check in instructions were thorough and easy! We would love to stay again.",1.0
Chicago,"Samantha's apartment was clean, cozy, and had great lighting. She was kind enough to let us store our luggage when we arrived early.

Chicago,"Samantha’s place is modern cute chic. Every piece of furniture is well thought out with aesthetic and function in mind. The steps to the loft bedroom: first, it’s very roomy up there and cozy. The steps itself could be problematic for people who are afraid of heights but for someone like me who is uncoordinated, it was surprisingly easy to navigate. Although, I didn’t need anything, Samantha made me feel like she was only an email/text/phone call away if I needed assistance or info. Also, there’s a small but very cute balcony where u can enjoy your morning coffee.",1.0
Chicago,Fun spot to serve as base camp to explore Chicago as you can reach a bunch of fun neighborhoods inside of 30 min. The unit itself was extremely clean and Samantha was super responsive. The lock box makes check in and out simple. Added touches like the full kitchen and French press are a bonus. ,1.0
Chicago,"I had a great stay at Samantha's. The space was lovely and very clean. I didnt spend much time here because I like to explore when I visit a new place, but I appreciated the relaxing and simple vibe of the space at the end of a long day. Samantha and I communicated via text and I found her to be very kind and accommodating regarding a specific inquiry that I had. If you're looking and this place is free, book it now!",1.0
Chicago,"Samantha's place was the perfect place to explore logan square, we used to live in the city and hadn't done much exploring there.

We got awesome suggestions on places to eat and drink and it doesn't take too long to get into the city. 10/10 would recommend!!",1.0
Chicago,"Samantha & Jonathan's loft was exactly as pictured, and located in a convenient location. I loved the apartment - I would love to live here myself! The stairs to the loft was quite steep as others describe, and I left my suitcase downstairs and only went upstairs to sleep. The bed was very comfortable. My friend whom I stayed with wanted an easy access to the bathroom during night, so she decided to use the air mattress downstairs, which we found in the closet (we moved furnitures around to make space). The walk to the California CTA station was 15-20 min for me, but since it was quite a cold week, I often opted for Uber. As we had packed plans in downtown, we did not get to explore much of the neighborhood nor get to ask for neighborhood tips that Samantha was happy to share, but I'd love to come back to this loft and explore more!",1.0
Chicago,"The loft is located in a great quiet spot that is walking distance from great restaurants and bars. It was a ~15 minute walk from both the Logan Square and California blue line stops, and extremely close to tons and tons of good restaurants and bars (check out Lula, Giant, and Longman & Eagle). Samantha was a great host and the place was spotless when we arrived, with tea and some nice snacks sitting on the table. Checking in and out was as easy and quick as it gets, and we appreciated Samantha periodically messaging us to check on our experience. We would stay here again in a heartbeat. Our only warning is that all the stairs in the building are extremely steep and narrow. We didn't have any problems, but you should be careful. Overall a 5/5 experience.",1.0
Chicago,"The space is exactly as pictured.  Simple, basic, perfect for one or two people.  The bed in the loft was comfortable and the HDTV had plenty of premium channels.  The neighborhood is quiet and we felt safe.  Parking on the street wasn't an issue for us, but it did seem to be full in the evening.  Major bus line is 3 blocks away that will take you straight to the northside Fullerton train stops and the Blue Line station that goes to the loop is about 8 blocks away.  The host is easily reached and communication was great.  Thanks!",1.0
Chicago,"I enjoyed my stay in this space! The studio itself was very clean and quiet during sleeping hours. The staircase to the bed was a little steeper than I had expected, but it was sturdy and I got used to it. It was in a lovely location that had access to buses and trains. I did do a bit of walking, but that was my choice. Samantha and Jonathan were quick with communication and gave suggestions for the area. I would stay again. Thanks!",1.0

Chicago,"Samantha's place is absolutely marvelous! It's located in a nice residential area, with some fun bars and restaurants in the neighborhood. If you don't want to wait for a bus, it's a bit of a walk to the blue line, but nothing bad. Uber rides into the city were not that expensive and an easy way to get into the city. The apartment itself is really, really nice. Clean, spacious and an extremely comfy bed. I would highly recommend it to anybody!",1.0
Chicago,A very stylish flat with lots of complimentary toiletries and helpful guide books for the area. The flat isn’t in the city centre but taking an Uber carpool is a cheap and easy way of getting into the main part.,1.0
Chicago,This is a beautifully-designed loft apartment in an upmarket part of town.  It is sparkling clean and has some nice touches such as local coffee. Communication with Samantha was very smooth and she answered our questions quickly.  I would highly recommend staying here in Chicago.,1.0
Chicago,"Lovely apartment in a great area of the city.  Local amenities were perfect (I'd recommend Tony's for any grocery requirement and Wyler Road for a chilled drink and a bit to eat!) and not too far from the ""L"" to the Loop where it's a 20 min ride in.   Hosts were great and very responsive to any request and requirement we had and helped out as much as possible.  The stairs up to the mezzanine are definitely steep but we expected this from the description so not a problem at all and the apartment is carefully thought out to give maximum usability of the space.  Overall a fantastic expperience of this amazing city.",1.0

The apartment is spacious and has everything you need including cooking facilities, big comfortable bed, tv etc. We were a bit delayed and arrived late in the evening, but Samantha was extremely kind by helping us ordering pizza while we were absolutely wrecked from traveling. Furthermore, she always responded very quickly to questions from us. We ran in to her husband Jonathan a couple of times who was also super friendly and gave us a ton of advice on what to do in the city. Overall we had a great couple of days in Chicago and we definitely recommend this place! ",1.0

In walking distance from Logan square, with nice coffee bars, restaurants, shops and street art. But also in walking distance from public transport that takes you to downtown in just a few stops. We would definitely recommend this place for a great visit to this great city",1.0
Chicago,"Lovely loft studio, spotlessly clean and very well designed with everything we needed. Location is good with the metro about 15 mins walk away then 20 mins to downtown, and a Chicago bike scheme station 5mins away and an even quicker cycle to downtown. We also enjoyed the 606 trail, Chicago's answer to the Highline which is also close by.  So a great place and a great location.",1.0
Chicago,Beautiful apartment in quite neighborhood. The space is great it's location relative to public transit is awesome. Samantha was quick to respond to any questions. I will definitely be checking availability next time I'm back in Chicago.,1.0
Chicago,"We had a great stay at Logan Square. The appartment was spacious (more so than we expected) and very clean with thoughtful provisions provided.   Samantha and Jonathon provided us with a great list of nearby places do eat and drink (from fresh coffee to pizza) and were very helpful in communicating when we asked for help.   Logan Sqaure itself is a lovely leafy neighbourhood around half an hr from Downtown on the train. There's plenty of amenities a short walk from the appartment, as well as loads of great bars. A taxi into Downtown is quicker but more expensive.   The 'L' (elevated train) is a 15-20 min walk from the appt and then a further 15 min or so ride into downtown where there is plenty to do. A weekly ticket for the train is around $30 and gives you access to trains and buses. Very handy for getting around as the bus and L system is easy to use.  On a clear day, we would recommend hiring a bike and taking the Lake Shore route which runs alongside Lake Michigan. You get stunning views of the iconic skyscrapers from across the water.  Hancock Tower on a clear day is also a must see too, with great views for miles.  If the weather is cooler, then there are loads of great museums to visit. the History of Chicago by Lincoln Park is great. The Old Town is nearby for a drink afterwards too.  Definitely a great city to visit with lots to do, and a great appartment in a great neighbourhood. 10/10  Thanks",1.0
Chicago,"The apartment was lovely, clean, and the coffee/snacks were appreciated. The security within the apartment was great, and although the surrounding area was less confidence-inspiring, she had us send a photo of our car once we arrived, and the area had cameras, so it put me at ease. We were super close to both bus and train options that we utilized several times, and within walking distance of target for quick pick-ups. We enjoyed our stay!",1.0
Chicago,"Kay is the best superhost you will ever have!! She is great with communication and is very welcoming! Her apartment has a home-like feeling that will make your vacation even better. Cleanest place ever!! Absolutely spotless and smells amazing!!  If you are looking for suggestions of where to eat and shop, Kay will give you a list of her favorite places and provides a variety brochures, pamphlets, flyers, and food menu’s! I had mentioned my family was vegan and she gave me options of food choices around the area!  Great location!!! I highly recommend staying at Kay’s place if you are visiting Chicago!!",1.0
Chicago,"Kay’s place was very cute and clean!! She was super quick to respond to anything. The train is a quick walk from the apartment though I don’t think I would personally feel safe walking from the train tooo late at night as a young lady. Loved how she  had treats available like bananas, it’s, orange juice, coffee. It is very convenient for a quick trip to downtown Chicago!",1.0
Chicago,"Even though Kay's place was more on the south side of Chicago and I was going to the north side for a Cubs game, her place was great for a one-night stay with how reasonably priced it was right before Memorial Day weekend. I just got ubers to get to and from the game rather than public transit. Kay's place was very comfortable and she was a great host!",1.0
Chicago,"Kay’s place was amazing! Such thoughtful, kind touches, and Kay is super communicative. Seriously, this room was nicer and more well-equipped than some of the luxury hotel’s I’ve stayed at. 100% would stay here again!",1.0
Chicago,"From the extreme cleanliness of the apartment to the added extras everywhere you turn, this place was absolutely perfect! The host is respectful and generous with the most friendly senior kitty ever! Coming “home” to a snuggly feline in the living room was probably the best thing ever (I’m an extreme cat person). However, if you’re not into cats, no worries; the cat isn’t pushy and you could probably spend your entire trip ~not~ seeing him if that’s more your style. The off-street parking was clean and safe, something that can be hard to secure in Chicago. The apartment is located very close to both the train and the bus, making in-city traveling quite easy. I would highly recommend this AirBnB!",1.0
Chicago,It’s a wonderful and comfortable place to stay. Kay is really great at communicating with guests and is super nice and welcoming. The space is very clean and has a nice charm to it. We only stayed for one night but I definitely will keep this place in mind if I ever make it up to Chicago again.,1.0
Chicago,I extremely enjoyed my stay at Kay's place.  The location is perfect. My favorite part was having a Target with a Starbucks and market near by. This place is also closely located to a CTA and the freeway entrance if you have a car.  Kay provides many good ameneties and I was very happy for that. She is quickly responsive and super helpful. I'm glad I got to meet her. She is a sweet person.  It is 15 min away from the city.    Also if you have a rental/car there is parking near by!!!  Thanks Kay,1.0
Chicago,"Five stars isn’t enough! Kay made me feel very welcome and comfortable. I felt as if I was staying with family or an old friend, definitely not a stranger. She provided breakfast and coffee for me before I headed out and it definitely gave me a great start. I have a cat at my place, so their friendly lil guy made me feel even more at home. I would definitely recommend her to anyone else and will definitely stay with her again if the opportunity arises.",1.0
Chicago,"I was pleasantly surprised by how amazing the experience turned out to be at Kay's home. The entire house felt inviting and immediately puts you at ease. She puts the guest first and it shows in her thoughtful approach to outfitting the room. From soft bath towels and a loofah at your bedside, to the coffee and tea bar in the kitchen for hot drinks in the morning. She really wants you to feel like you are taken care of the moment you walk in the door. The location is convenient with good selection of restaurants in the area to choose from and downtown is a hop and a skip away for those who want to take in the sights. If it isn't obvious already,  I highly recommend staying with Kay during your trip to Chicago!",1.0
Chicago,"I stayed at Kay's place with two of my friends over St. Pat's weekend. The free parking was a huge blessing, and the apartment was very close to the CTA for local travel.

Also, there were loads of local brochures and magazines to browse. Her 16 year old cat Toby is such a love! He was super friendly and sweet. It was raining on the day I was going out to adventure in the city and I Kay was so cool about lending me her umbrella. She’s a kind soul and was so helpful with local tips for eats and getting around. Highly recommend staying at Kay’s!",1.0

The apartment and room were cozy and I felt like being at home during my stay, with access to kitchen and living room area. The cat is super friendly too!   Kay as a person was a nice host. She even gave me some medicine upon request, as I was catching some cold from the weather in Chicago.   If I ever come back to Chicago I have a reliable place to stay :)",1.0
Chicago,"Kay is an absolute pro of a host.  She communicated check-in instructions very clearly and regularly  touched-base to make sure I had everything I needed during my stay.  Her place is ideally situated a mere 5 minute walk from an L train station (which is a fantastic way to get around Chicago as I discovered).  Very comfortable, clean, and safe place to spend your nights when visiting Chicago-- can't recommend enough.",1.0
Chicago,"The misfortune of staying at Kay's is that one will quickly realize that not every host will be like her! :-/ I was able to take the train (as she pre-stay suggested) directly out of midway and walk about 2 blocks & if cleanliness is next to godliness, then trust Kay has you covered. And to be completely honest, Kay extended herself to me in an act that goes way beyond the scope of AirBnb. I was comfortable, I felt safe, the room was very dedicated. Being that she was my 1st AirBnb experience,  I really feel like I lucked up. Omg, and her snack bar (fresh yummies), were too delish! :-* #BookHer",1.0
Chicago,"Kay is a fantastic host and I can not recommend her enough. When we contacted her for anything we needed, the response was lightning-fast!

Communication with Danielle was fantastic and we had everything we could have imagined and more during our stay!",1.0
Chicago,Danielle's place is great! It's conveniently located near Chicago's most hip neighborhood Logan Square with a ton of nice bars and restaurants. It's also very easy to get to using public transportation. We loved the decorations of the apartment. It's very cute. In the winter the heated floor is a plus. We had a wonderful time in Chicago thanks to Danielle's hospitality. We hope to stay with her again in the near future.,1.0
Chicago,We had a great stay at Danielle’s place. The space was perfect for our group of 4. The place was so clean and had the cutest decor! The location was also perfect. Walking distance to so many restaurants and bars in Logan square and about a 20 minute uber to downtown. Would definitely stay here again!,1.0
Chicago,"I’ve stayed at several Airbnb spots throughout Chicago over the past year for work travel, and this was easily one of the best. The space is incredibly charming with very thoughtful touches, it’s minutes from the Blue line, and in one of the best neighborhoods in the city for great food.  If you want explore the Logan Square neighborhood or just want a nice place with easy access to downtown, I’d definitely recommend staying here.",1.0
Chicago,"This has got to be in the top two best airbnb experiences I've had. Danielle's place is so cozy and looks amazing. We ended up spending a lazy Sunday lounging inside by the fireplace and watching dumb movies - an ideal way to spend a day after heavy touristing Friday and Saturday. She was incredibly accommodating throughout our stay with complications our party had with check in and check out. The surrounding area had an incredible pizza place, a bar where we got boozy ice cream floats, some breweries, and way more that we didn't have time to discover because we didn't want to leave the fire. Will 100% look to stay here again in the future!",1.0

Everything we needed was there, dish washer, washing machine with dryer, fast internet, nice big screen TV. I especially enjoyed all the books in the apartment!  Checking in was effortless with good instructions. Location is good, easy access from the airport and to the city with the CTA blue line. Logan Square neighborhood, while still a bit rough around the edges, is very interesting. Lots of good eateries, galleries and shops. You have to check out Lula Cafe.",1.0
Chicago,"Stayed a wintery week in Danielle's cozy space. The apartment was exactly as published and proved to be a nice base for exploring Chicago. The train was an easy walk and Logan Square is a cool and friendly neighborhood. From day one, Danielle proved to be a good communicator and a welcoming host. I would definitely consider staying with her again.",1.0

The owners were super responsive and kind. Highly recommend it! We will be back! Thanks for a great stay!",1.0
Chicago,This was a truly desperate search for a safe place for my daughter to stay last minute while out of town.  She made last minute plans to travel to Chicago for the Gold Cup soccer match.  Once there she could not find a hotel to rent to her because she is 18.  She was in her car crying.  I booked with Jim on the internet and spoke with him by phone.  He was so great!!!  He met her and her boyfriend at the door.  He even spoke Spanish with her boyfriend which made him feel great.  He assured me by phone about how safe the neighborhood  was and that he would be on the premises just a moments notice away.  He treated them like adults but still helped me feel comfortable about their safety knowing they will always be my babies.  It was truly above and beyond.  And my daughter said the apartment was gorgeous.,1.0

The modern touch to the retro atmosphere made the apartment feel both cozy and familiar. We weren't bothered by any noise in the neighborhood neither during the day nor through the night.

Chicago,"This place is lovely. It’s a very clean and well restored apartment.  The windows are about at ground level, so actually the floor of the apartment is 2-3’ below ground level.  We liked this, it felt cozy and being on the ground floor was very convenient. The design of the kitchen and living room is very nice, the bedrooms are comfortable and private. Took a few baths, nice bathroom. It was very quiet, almost no street noise. Just a few blocks from Clark street and a few more to the train. We loved staying here!",1.0

Chicago,"Jim & Maximo’s apartment is beautiful & well located. This was our 3rd visit to Chicago for a girls weekend; first time in Andersonville. Nice quiet neighborhood with Uber/lyft convenience to most city locations in 15-20 min. Apartment is on ground floor, some street noise but overall very quiet. Neighborhood is safe with quick walks to great eating spots. We recommend the little red wolf & mhenry.  Apartment is well furnished with nice appliances & conveniences, great WiFi. Host was attentive, but only needed on day 1: we’re pretty low key. Only recommendation would be additional blankets/ linens for pull out couch in living area.",1.0
Chicago,"From the moment I booked, everything was five stars. I never waited on a reply. I was behind schedule on check in day, nevertheless, Maximo promptly greeted me and I checked in immediately.

I could not have asked for a better experience!",1.0
Chicago,"Our stay in Chicago was great and we really enjoyed staying in Andersonville. It was far enough away to be quiet but only a 12-15 minute walk to the train station, which we didn’t mind at all. The neighborhood felt safe enough to walk in and we liked the local coffee shops and restaurants.   The apartment was nicely decorated and clean. I would just give a heads up that if you’re a light sleeper you can hear the hosts upstairs because it’s an old building. I would never take away a star for this because it’s just a personal thing. My wife is a heavy sleeper and it never bothered her but I had to download a white noise app on my phone to fall asleep.   The hosts were great communicators and asked if we needed anything and how our stay was going. We both enjoyed it and would stay here again!",1.0
Chicago,"Jim's place is just as pictured and described and was a lovely, comfortable, clean and quiet place to stay while I visited family and friends in the Chicago area. The location is halfway between the main city and Evanston, which was perfect for me, and it was very close to some really cool restaurants/bakeries, etc. Had no trouble getting around and found parking on the street each night without trouble. Safe and quiet neighborhood. Jim and Maximo were very attentive and had supplied everything I needed for my stay. Would definitely stay there again.",1.0

Chicago,"Jim's place was FANTASTIC. The place was exactly what we expected it to be from the fabulous photos which were 100% accurate showing off the truly lovely and well decorated apartment. Very clean, well appointed, extra towels and pillows, fantastic magazines for relaxing reading, GREAT map of the local neighborhood in order to find fantastic local shops and places to eat.  You can totally get around on public transit (mostly CTA Bus) from this apartment. Note: the place is a little far from the CTA train stations into downtown. We rented a car and really appreciated the flexibility to get around the city easily and great neighborhood street parking.   The apartment is well appointed with everything you need for your stay. One of the bedrooms is street facing but there is not much traffic so it stayed very quiet at night. Air conditioning for the summer time is a huge plus on muggy hot days!  Andersonville neighborhood is one of my favorite areas of Chicago. It is quaint, full of local  charm, great eats and drinks within walking distance, and a fantastic way to get a feel of what real Chicago is like (and not the fake touristy stuff). Off the beaten path geek thing we did - we drove to and walked through the nearby Rosehill Cemetery Mausoleum. The old original section has a substantial collection of LC Tiffany stained glass windows and walking the completely silent hallways to see the sun shining through these beautiful windows is pretty awesome if you like that sort of thing.  Love Jim's place! Beyond 5 stars! We will hopefully be back to town and rent out his apartment again in the future. ",1.0
Chicago,"Great space to spend a few days. Neighborhood was a few miles north of the downtown area of Chicago. Very quiet but still had the Chicago city feel to it.

Chicago,"Jim and Maximo were great hosts! This spacious two-bed, one-bath is the perfect getaway for family and friends! I picked Andersonville, because it's a great LGBTQ+ friendly neighborhood and was a great location to experience all of the Pride festivities happening over the weekend during our stay. Jim and Maximo were super responsive and very accommodating throughout my entire experience even before arriving for the weekend! The neighborhood is a family-friendly area and was very walk-able with lots of places to go for food, coffee or to go grocery shopping.

It's very close to all the Andersonville shops and restaurants on Clark St. and a short walk to the el stop to go downtown; it's in a lovely, quiet, leafy neighborhood of brownstones. Parking was easy -- there was street parking right outside the apartment; we parked the car when we arrived Friday and didn't need to move it or use it until we left on Sunday. The apartment was very clean and well-appointed, with a great kitchen and nice amenities. Jim was there to give us the keys when we checked in; he and Maximo were available if needed but also gave us space. We'd highly recommend this one!",1.0

This is a great apartment with caring and involved hosts. I recommend staying here unconditionally!",1.0
Chicago,"The apartment was beautiful and very spacious. There are restaurants, grocery stores and pharmacies within walking distance. The neighborhood seemed very safe and we enjoyed walking around even in the cold weather. The Keurig and snack basket were nice touches which we appreciated. The beds were  too firm to be comfortable for me, but my boyfriend was fine with it, so it may be personal preference. Jim and Maximo were very attentive and always ready to help. Please note, the apartment does not have a microwave. Also, there is a policy that you cannot have any guest enter into the apartment (not just for sleeping, but for visiting too) which I misunderstood when booking, but it was not a problem since it was only the two of us. If you're traveling in a group or with family staying in other places, you may want to look for another place if you want them to be able to visit you. Overall our stay was lovely and we would recommend this apartment.",1.0

Loved it!",1.0

First: it is it's own little building in the city. Wow! It's designed so beautifully, I took tons of photos to inspire my guest house back in CT. Elinor was responsive, accommodating, and super nice. I'm spreading the word to all of my friends who are jazzed staying there. The location is 10-12 minutes from downtown... well worth it for these gorgeous accommodations. BTW: the photos don't really capture the details and inviting sweetness of the place. I'll see you again, Elinor!",1.0
Chicago,"Ellie and Devin's space is charming! It's a well-designed, well-maintained large studio with incredibly thoughtful touches: books about the history of Chicago, more books from Chicago based writers and poets, games, postcards, and even stamps. I was a little nervous the first night with the studio being so close to the street, but I slept like a dream – the bed is comfortable and the studio is airy and bright. The place is exactly as pictured, even better. Ellie and Devin were very responsive and helpful. I would definitely come back and highly recommend staying here.",1.0

Basically I’m sad I can’t just move and stay in forever. People always say, “oh I’ll be back” but this is serious, I can’t wait to book again! I have best friends who live in the city and I’d still pay to stay in this awesome space! Airbnb MVP! Don’t hesitate! Book it now!",1.0
Chicago,"What you see on the photos are absolutely accurate and more! Loved the open space, high ceilings and obviously the bath. I've been using Airbnb for most of my travels and this is one of the nicest and most aesthetically pleasing location I have ever stayed at!",1.0
Chicago,"My fiancé and I were in town to celebrate our anniversary weekend. We couldn't have picked a better place to stay. The open layout, soft lighting, and claw foot tub all made it seem like a dream. Thank you so much!",1.0
Chicago,"Ellie was fantastic, super fast responses to my emails. Her place was fantastic, and right in the neighborhood where we needed to be. Hate to say this, but she could easily get more per night given the location and how awesome the space is.   Cheers!",1.0
Chicago,"Great place! Great host! We actually had major delays on our flight out of Chicago and she offered for us to stay another night. We felt loved and cared for. If you want a spot not in the downtown hustle but still in the city enough to Uber for good rates, look no further. Quiet neighborhood. Pictures described the space very accurately. It was the perfect space for a quick getaway to Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"Amazing and beautiful first airbnb experience. The place was decorated very modern and was clean. Both the walk in shower and claw-foot tub were great and the water got very hot. The bed was super comfy! There were plenty of towels, extra sheets, and blankets to use as well. There were also nice personal touches such as food recommendations and stocked beverages in the fridge (water filter, coffee, and some wine). Me and my boyfriend had an amazing time.",1.0
Chicago,"Wonderful place to stay while visiting the windy city of Chicago! Not far from great restaurant, bars, shopping and downtown. The coach house is decorated to perfection in mid-century modern decor and very clean. My husband and I used Uber all weekend and waiting no longer than 2 min. for a pickup at the house.  Highly recommend a stay at this location.",1.0
Chicago,"Great place to stay in Chicago. The space is very functionable and artsy, open and airy- we loved it. Comfy bed, all amenities you would want and then far more are provided. There are even beautiful post cards for you to write home with! Highly recommend it!",1.0
Chicago,Ellie’s place is exactly what you see in the all - no false advertising. It’s very light and open and she maximizes the space greatly. She’s very easy to communicate with. The Damen & Western L stations are close enough walk which we utilized a lot. Would definitely stay here again!,1.0
Chicago,"Gorgeous! I loved staying here. It was in a cool neighborhood and the studio was clean, styled well, and the bathroom was top notch. I want to stay here every time I come back to Chicago. They also have postcards and stamps for your use. Sweet little detail. Thanks so much!",1.0
Chicago,"This is a fantastic place. Super bright, extremely clean, great design, and extremely comfortable. Parking was easy. Check in and check out were super convenient and Elinor was very responsive. Can’t recommend highly enough!",1.0
Chicago,Eleanor's place was fantastic! Every detail was thought of including the courtesy postcards depicting her cat who sits in the window in the house on Artesian Street on the front. I would come back to Chicago just to hang out in this cool Studio for a weekend.,1.0
Chicago,"This is a gem of a space that is a close walk to some great cafes, shopping, and night life. As someone who travels a fair amount, I would say this was one of my favorite stays at an AirBNB. The space itself is very thoughtfully curated. ",1.0
Chicago,"There is a reason so many reviews start with how stylish the place is. That reason is because it is stunning and just as advertised! The level of detail and thought put in to the design is unbelievable.   Location is great, quick walk to the blue line. Check in/out is super easy, and the studio manual made our interactions minimal.   Great place to stay, will absolutely repeat.   Thanks again!",1.0
Chicago,"This place was great. It's worth the price just to swim around in that huge bathtub. Ellie was a great host, and the apartment had everything you could need for a great time in Chicago. I found most places I needed to go (food, cute shops, metro) to be about a ~10 min walk away, which I don't mind because I love to walk, but if you don't consider getting a car. It was really easy to get to downtown using the train. I have no complaints, this was an awesome  place!",1.0
Chicago,"This is such a cute, clean and comfortable space! I could stay here for weeks! Nice little neighborhood. Had initially worried about noise at night, but it did quiet down for a restful evening.  The fresh ground coffee, sodas, beer help to make it comfortable. Nice distance from downtown. Safe to run in the mornings with a park nearby. Love this place!",1.0
Chicago,"Ellie’s studio is absolutely stunning! She goes above & beyond for her guest! There are loads of local nicknacks laying around the studio to indulge into. She has her cabinets stocked with things one might need (ibuprofen, cotton swabs, razors, etc). The neighbor hood is very nice. There are not many of taxi’s in the area, so if you don’t drive one might want to download uber. Definitely worth the stay! Would definitely come back!",1.0
Chicago,"Fantastic stay! The studio was as pristine as pictured. You felt more like you were staying in a hotel than someone's home. Great amenities like shampoo, soft towels and even yoga mats! Would highly recommend,",1.0
Chicago,"Elinor's studio was a magical place, and I could tell as I soon as I stepped up to the door, because care was taken in styling the exterior with little faerie lights that sparkled. I hate to say this, but I can be a bit of snob when it comes aesthetic and decor. I have not one complaint about this studio. I was absolutely blown away. The incredible level of detail and design, even down to the studio's handbook was meticulous and thought out.  What's even more wonderful is the central location to all the haunts in the Bucktown/Wicker Park area. I drove and literally everywhere I went was less than a 10 minutes away. I can't imagine that taking public transportation would take any longer. If you do drive, Elinor provides a parking permit, which gives you the freedom to park anywhere in the vivinity without the fear of getting a ticket.  By far Elinor's place is one of the best spots I've stayed in for Air BnB. If you're looking for something magical and romantic (oh, I forgot to mention there's wonderfully restored claw-foot Victorian bath tub) look no further.",1.0
Chicago,Stayed here while visiting Chicago. The apartment was really clean and cozy and located in a really good location for our trip. We were able to park right out front for our stay and walk everywhere. If you're looking to spend time in the Ukrainian Village i would recommend staying here. Close to the train if ya want to travel other places too.,1.0
Chicago,"The initial observation of the space was of course a stylish space for a reasonable price.  Seeing the space in person is such an enjoyable experience - especially when noticing all the fine details not revealed in the online pics.  It is in those details that raises the level of impression and sets it apart from other spaces.    Elinor and I had minimal contact, but that was because instructions were clear on the check-in and check-out procedures, where to park, and even how to make the coffee - which we were thoroughly confused at first.    I enjoy exploring different places to stay when visiting areas, but I would consider staying here again on my next trip to Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"I enjoyed my stay at Elinor's studio apartment in Wicker Park.  The location was pefect for me.  The studio was quite stylish and had many personal touches, including a studio manual which I found quite helpful and fun.  I really appreciated the 2 bottles of wine and the beer selection in the fridge.  The kitchen was minimal but that was fine with me because I planned to enjoy Chicago's dining scene.  The bed was  very confortable, which was a definite plus.  The heater was somewhat louder than I was expecting, but that is the only concern I had.  I would definitely stay here again.",1.0
Chicago,"This is a great spot. Located near hip Wicker Park and related. Quiet, good access to Metro and very pleasant spot to hang out and do some work too. Hostess was very helpful on restaurants etc . This is a top BnB!!!",1.0
Chicago,"The space is exactly as described. Gorgeous. The bathroom is stylish, clean, and the shower is great. Would love to have a space like that in my own home tbh. They have cute touches throughout the studio, including Where Chefs Eat (I have that at home too!) and Studs Terkel's ""Working"" in the bathroom. The bed was really comfortable and once we figured out how to configure the NEST properly for our purposes, the temperature control was on point. One minor note is that both heat and cool air come out predominantly at the head of the bed, and it could be bothersome to people who are sensitive to dry air. My wife had to turn to the foot of the bed one night because she's super sensitive, but it didn't bother me much. The location was good for me because I don't need to be right downtown and don't mind taking a Lyft everywhere, plus I like to be in ""real"" neighborhoods. Puerto Rican restaurants abound as well as cool street art, if you care to venture around. It's about a twenty minute drive to many downtown area attractions. The hosts were very accommodating to my needs, as I had to cancel one day due to a family emergency. They were very easy to work with throughout. Will definitely look to return here my next stay in Chicago",1.0
Chicago,Elinor's place is close to perfect. Every corner of the space is thoughtfully detailed and styled. It's located very centrally to Logan Square and the Bucktown/Wicker Park area and I enjoyed walking the neighborhood in my downtime. Her communication was clear and extremely quick and I truly cannot say enough about how pleasant my stay was. Highly recommended.,1.0
Chicago,"Before I arrived, I loved the photos and thought the place would be perfect for my stay over New Year's. Walking in, it was somehow even better. From the furniture to the lighting to the tableware, everything in the space is very intentionally curated. I have a feeling the owners are designers; the whole place has a great aesthetic while still being comfortable. One of my favorite places I've stayed so far",1.0
Chicago,"We had a great stay at this charming, stylish studio. Clean digs and thoughtful touches like coffee, beer, and wine were lovely. Location was perfect for getting around town by foot or Lyft, yet the street itself was quiet and residential. Great host communication and simple check in and check out. Would stay again in a heartbeat!",1.0
Chicago,"I love this spot . The layout, decor and vibe are definitely hip. Everything is so easy + the communication with Elinor is on point. The amenities are great . The experience is very hommie , every time you discover little details that make a difference in your stay.   If you’re looking for something local, not loud ,  away from tourists this is definitely a good location.",1.0
Chicago,"Ellie’s place is so so wonderful! Chic, stylish, beautiful location from which you can easily access the trendiest Chicago area, Wicker Park. Ellie responds in mere minutes should you need anything and the keypad entry makes it so easy to come and go as you please, no need for keys! 10/10 would recommend and hope to stay here again! ❤️",1.0
Chicago,"Beautiful decor with so much space! Instructions for checkin were easy to follow. The coffee and extras were great!  Very comfortable bed! The apartment has an urban ambiance. Jeremy provided parking passes and we were able to find parking a block away. Communication was excellent. Jeremy answered any questions I had almost immediately. Neighborhood had a safe feel. We walked to local restaurants close by. One unfortunate thing, which was no fault of our host- when we went to leave, we discoveredthat our catalytic converter was stolen off of our car. I had driven our older SUV since I knew it would be parked for several days. Turns out, these are easiervehicles to get under and cut. I would not hesitate to stay here again.",1.0
Chicago,"This Airbnb is the best! Location and space are the key highlights! Jeremy has great design taste! Close to the train and many restaurants. We would definitely stay here again! If you’re visiting, try the rolled ice cream across the street! We had it twice!",1.0
Chicago,"The apartment was absolutely fantastic and everything was as good as advertised. The entire unit was much more spacious than it appeared in the photos which was a welcomed surprise as I have stayed in several Airbnb's that were smaller than photographed.   You could not ask for a better location, one block from the blue line which made traveling to/from O'Hare and into downtown a breeze. You're also within walking distance to countless top notch restaurants and shops.  Jeremy was a very responsive and accommodating host and he really made us feel taken care of when we had some flight plan changes. I would recommend this apartment to anyone wanting to visit Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"There is much to like about this apartment.  It's spacious, has full amenities, plenty of character, parking is included, and the place is clean.  Wicker Park is growing, has a unique vibe, feels safe, and offers options within walking distance for groceries.  The area also has many choices for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and drinks.  We chose to use the kitchen for breakfast, and the waffle maker was a great perk.  A critical factor in comfort, rest and relaxation is the bed.  While clean, we found the mattress to be uncomfortable.  It currently presents itself as firm and lumpy with indentations and sag from years of use.  Upgrading this one very important item would make this location, apartment, and experience worth renting again.  We enjoyed our stay overall and will keep this as an option in the future.",1.0
Chicago,"Came to Chicago for my cousin's birthday party. It was in my old neighborhood, so I felt very much at home. The place was spacious and exactly how it was described! I briefly meet Jeremy when I arrived, he was extremely nice. Would love to come back here when I visit Chicago again.",1.0
Chicago,"I loved this loft and everything about it.  The location was great - 1.5 blocks from the CTA - we were able to explore the entire city using public transportation.  Check in and check out were a breeze.  Jeremy was kind and offered great suggestions when we met briefly during the stay.  The apartment was spotlessly clean, comfortable, quiet and well appointed.  This was my first visit to Chicago and I would gladly stay here on my next trip.",1.0
Chicago,"We loved this place. It's spacious and very convenient. If you have small children, you may want to know that there is a firehouse nearby, but it did not bother us, we expected city noises. There's a Metro station barely a block away. It's great to have a washer and dryer right in the apartment since we tend to pack very lightly. We greatly appreciated the neighborhood parking stickers Jeremey provided and we easily found parking about 1 block away on a safe, residential street. We'll stay here again next time we're in town.",1.0
Chicago,"This is a large, 1 bedroom apartment within 2 blocks of the blue line. Very convenient! There’s a well equipped full kitchen with a small grocery across the street. Of course there a numerous great restaurants in the area so there’s no need to cook. The apartment was very comfortable and clean. We had plenty of pillows, blankets, towels etc. which was much appreciated.",1.0
Chicago,"This was my very first AirBnB and if all of them are like this one, I'll never stay in a hotel again. Jeremey's communication was excellent from start to finish and his home is so beautiful and immaculate. It is easy to find and right off the blue line. The home had EVERYTHING I needed and then some. He even left me 2 day parking passes for the area which made people coming by easy to park nearby. It is in a very cool neighborhood and as a single woman staying in an area I've never been, I felt very safe. When I visit again, I would definitely stay there again.",1.0
Chicago,Jeremey is a wonderful host and his place is extremely nice. He is quick to respond with any questions and is willing to give recommendations around the city. The place was clean and decorated with care. It has everything you would need during your stay.,1.0
Chicago,"Jeremy's apartment is exactly as advertised - stylish, large, comfortable and spotlessly clean in a very safe, hip neighborhood.  The kitchen has all you would need to fix your own meals.  We, however, opted to take advantage of the multitude of excellent bars, coffee shops and restaurants within very easy walking distance on Division Street and North Milwaukee Avenue (for lovers of high quality Nepalese / Indian food we recommend Cumin on North Milwaukee). Communication with Jeremy was very easy.  If and when we return to this part of Chicago Wicker we would, without hesitation choose to stay in Jeremy's place.",1.0
Chicago,"We were very pleased with the apartment. With an updated modern kitchen and bathroom we had everything we needed to be comfortable. Jeremy was a great host, communicated all details we needed when needed.",1.0
Chicago,Jeremy's place was fantastic! It is really big. Was great to unpack and have space and feel at home. Really close to the blue line. Easy to get anywhere. Felt safe in the neighborhood. Fire station next door but never bothered us or woke us up. Would definitely stay again!,1.0
Chicago,Our stay was great! Jeremey was very responsive when we asked him about accommodating our two dogs during the stay. There was even a small crate provided that we ended up using for the smaller pup. Everything was just as described and the apartment is close to many great restaurants and shops. We'd stay again! :),1.0
Chicago,"Jeremey's place is fantastic -- it's bigger than we were expecting and has a really nice overall feel to it.  It's nicely decorated and has all the amenities you would need.  Jeremey was very quick to respond to messages and helped out if anything at all was needed.  Check-in was simple and the building felt secure.  It's just a couple minutes' walk to the blue line, which brings you right into downtown in about 10 minutes.  Also close to some cool spots on N Milwaukee, like Oiistar, the amazing ramen place.  Super nice experience and we'd definitely stay with Jeremey again!",1.0
Chicago,"This was perfect for our needs.  Everything was as advertised.  It's a beautiful space and the location is great.  (Ashland itself is not too appealing but you're a one-minute walk from blue line, can stroll west on Division or walk up Milwaukee Ave to Bucktown.).  Self-checkin was super easy and we had everything we needed.",1.0
Chicago,"Jeremy was very responsive, answering all questions quickly and thoroughly.  His place was nice and very clean.  My parents stayed at the Air BnB to visit me and were quite pleased.  Being that I own and live in downtown Chicago, I can say that this location fantastic and the price to be a great value.",1.0
Chicago,This place is one of the nicest accommodations I have ever stayed at. Yes the price is expensive compared to a hotel but if you want a solid night's sleep and little slice of home be sure to check out Jeremy's place!,1.0
Chicago,Wonderful place.  We really enjoyed ourselves and relaxed at Jeremey's loft.  Very clean.  We enjoyed being able to watch people on the streets from the loft.  Love the mixture of cultures which we don't get much of back home.  Location was great.  Very quick walk to get to Wicker Park and many great local restaurants as well.  Felt very safe in the neighborhood and at Jeremey's place.  Super nice people.  Jeremey is fantastic at returning messages.  Always a quick reply and we had no problems at all that couldn't be fixed quickly.  Highly recommend Jeremey's loft!,1.0
Chicago,"Jeremey's apartment far exceeded our expectations.  The pictures don't do justice to how beautiful, stylish and very spacious this place is, not to mention comfortable and clean.  Everything was simply perfect.  Every possible amenity to make you feel right at home--we wanted for nothing.  Comfortable bed and couches, beautiful, roomy bathroom with large shower and plenty of hot water, fully stocked kitchen, excellent wi-fi and incredibly easy check-in process. We loved the location, merely 2 short blocks (roughly 3 min) walk to the Blue line on the L/ subway.  So easy to get to the main attractions downtown, but also in a great spot to explore the Wicker Park/ West Town neighborhoods and all the great restaurants and shops.  An excellent Airbnb experience--Thank you, Jeremey!!",1.0
Chicago,We found it exactly as advertised—perhaps even better. Super accommodations in a great location. Jeremey was very accessible and promptly responded to our requests and questions. We look forward to staying there again on our next trip to Chicago.,1.0
Chicago,We LOVED the location. The area seemed very safe and was central to the blue line and a Divvy bike station. (Tip: take the blue line to and from O’hare to save a lot of money on transportation) The apartment was very roomy and we enjoyed having access to a kitchen. Something to note is the TV does not have cable or “smart” access. We ended up buying a firestick so we had something to watch while winding down at the end of our days. Jeremy was quick to respond any time we had questions or needed anything! Thank you for a great stay!,1.0
Chicago,"Better than it looked online, a beautiful space with everything needed and then some. Great location, close to public transportation and wonderful local spots. Jeremy was attentive and helpful with all of my queries. Would stay here whenever I’m in Chicago. Can’t recom enough!",1.0
Chicago,"This is a beautiful unit in a great neighborhood in Chicago.  Jeremy was a great host and was easy to communicate with.  Check-in and check-out were a breeze and the apartment was spotless.  It's on a busy street but there was very little noise.  The blue line is a block away as are Target, CVS and a bunch of great coffee shops and places to eat.  Also super easy to pick up a cab or an Uber/Lyft.  Would recommend this place without hesitation!",1.0
Chicago,Communication was fast and easy and Jeremey was available every step of the way.    Apartment was better than I expected.  Great location and very close to the Blue Line which can get you just about anywhere.     Would absolutely recommend and would stay here again in the future.   ,1.0
Chicago,"This is a spacious apartment and very nicely furnished. The location is just a few minutes walk from the blue line with quick transportation direct to the heart of downtown. Check-in was easy and the host provided a sheet with lots of helpful suggestions for local eating places, of which there are many.  Staying at Jeremey's place for 4 nights provided a very comfortable place to stay for our tired bodies after spending our days exploring Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,Jeremey’s place is very spacious and clean.  It has everything you need for a short or long term stay.  Jeremey is very nice and answers any question very promptly.  The location is also very convenient for travel on public transport.  Highly recommended!,1.0
Chicago,"Couldn't have asked for a better place. It was super easy to get to and from both town and O'Hare, with a Blue Line stop only one block away. It was beautiful and cheerful as well. Loved the full kitchen and nice extra-large tub. Jeremey was a lovely host. I wish we could have stayed even longer!",1.0
Chicago,"Great location with convenient transportation. The neighborhood has a cool vibe. As a vinyl record collector, I was excited about being across the street from Dusty Groove and close to Reckless Records. Great overall experience.",1.0
Chicago,"My wife and I spent 2 nights at Jeremey's place. While pictures can often be deceiving, we were pleasantly surprised at how large and open the apartment was in person. It was perfect. Jeremey was traveling in Spain at the time, but he was quick to respond to questions we had the day of and during the trip about things such as checking in and adjusting the nest thermostat. We'd happily stay there again.",1.0
Chicago,Great space in a convenient location—a vibrant neighborhood and just a block from blue line. The apartment has a good vibe and personality and is very clean. Jeremy was attentive and responsive. I’ll go back.,1.0
Chicago,"Jeremey's apartment is really great. It's large and bright in all the right places (and quieter and darker in the bedroom, which is lovely for sleeping), stylishly decorated (without being overdone--the decor fits the urban space perfectly), has a fantastic shower, everything you need for a comfortable stay and is in one of my favorite Chicago neighborhoods, with a bajiggety restaurants, bars, shops, etc. The provided parking passes are super helpful, especially for weekend stays, because parking in this part of the city is no joke (in fact, if you can manage without a car, do, because you won't need it once you're here--everything is walkable, lyft/uber is plentiful and the El train is literally right there.)  If mobility is an issue for you, you should know that you have to walk up a flight of steep, narrow stairs to get to the apartment. Also, it's really in the real city, and real cities generally aren't that quiet, so if you're a super sensitive sleeper who needs deep, dark silence, you'll maybe want to bring ear plugs and/or a sleep mask.   But otherwise, I completely recommend this place. Jeremey is a kind, helpful and responsive host, the apartment is so lovely, and it's a really great value for Chicago, too.",1.0
Chicago,"We enjoyed our stay at Jeremy’s place. It's conveniently located, about 15 minutes to the loop and 20 minutes to Midway airport. Although we got around with Uber, the blue line is just minutes across the street. The apartment is super clean and lovely decorated. Jeremy is very thoughtful with the travel guide and tips. It was great to meet a Cal alumni at Chicago. =) I would recommend this listing to everyone.",1.0
Chicago,"This home was great. Jeremey provided easy check in details and instructions. The location was great because I was close to everything downtown and many shops and stores. I recommend this home and would certainly stay here again. Thanks again, Jeremey!",1.0
Chicago,"Jeremy was easily accessible for any questions via text and he even checked in the second day to make sure everything was okay. The apartment spacious, comfortable and centrally located. Just a few steps to the blue line CTA train, restaurants and shops. The neighborhood is busy so the provided parking permits were a huge plus.",1.0
Chicago,"This space is amazing. Plenty of room, furnishings are great, kitchen has everything you could need, and the shower was perfect after a long day of exploring Chicago in the cold. Jeremey was prompt with responses and great about giving me tips on places to check out. Literally just a few steps away from the Blue Line which made getting around the city super easy. I will definitely be looking to get this place again next time I am in Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"Great place! We stayed there with our 18month during our summer holiday trip, all three of us loved Jeremey’s place. Bigger than expected. Jeremey was very supportive and fast with all kind of questions. We can highly recommend this place, also when you are traveling with small children.",1.0
Chicago,"What a great stay in Chicago!!! Jeremey‘s loft is perfectly situated in one of our favourite areas within Chicago. There are so many things to explore in walking distance: restaurants, shopping, parks, and the great 606 trail. The train („L“, blue line) - which is more or less directly in front of the apartment - connects you directly with downtown as well as with the airport. The apartment is so cool, we would love to live there! Despite the busy street in front of the house the apartments inside is so quiet and we slept like babies. Jeremey is a fantastic host and helped us a lot to find our ways, gave us great recommendations and answered immediately whenever we wrote a message. We will definitely come again!!!",1.0
Chicago,"A very spacious and spotlessly clean apartment, it holds special charm with bare brick walls and wooden floors with plenty of seating and a very large bed with a well equipped dressing room.  The bathroom is great with a very impressive bath for easing away the muscles after a long day of exploring.  We didn’t use the kitchen much apart from making a hot drink as we ate out most of the time but there is a great health food shop just opposite and a food shop just by the subway station.  Although we didn’t get to meet Jeremey his communication with us was superb.",1.0
Chicago,"Jeremy’s place is amazing, not only is it huge, it has everything you need for a comfortable stay, it’s in a great location for getting around town (literally one minute walk from the blue line at Division), and really easy to get to on the blue line from O’hare airport.  Jeremy was a fantastic host, very quick to respond to any queries we had, and was kind enough to let us leave our bags for a couple of hours while we went for brunch before heading back to the airport.  I would highly recommend his apartment to anyone wanting to explore Chicago.",1.0

Chicago,"Rob’s place was beautiful! It looked exactly as advertised. The apartment was spacious & stylishly decorated. Lots of restaurants & bars within walking distance, as well as a grocery store. Rob was super responsive & hospitable. We were not able to check in before 3, but he allowed us to leave our luggage in his store prior to check in & even took it upstairs to the apartment for us! The only downside was that the bedroom can get a little warm, especially on a hot summer day. Other than that, we fully enjoyed our stay. Would definitely stay here again!",1.0
Chicago,"Rob’s Place was beautifully furnished and decorated. It was also only a 3 minute walk from the nearest bus stop which can take you to downtown or any of the metro/L lines - very convenient. The only downside is that there is no air conditioning in the bedroom so it got really hot. It is also on the 3rd floor so that’s something to consider if you don’t like taking the stairs. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and would recommend it!",1.0
Chicago,Rob's place is immaculate! I have never seen an Airbnb so tastefully decorated and cozy. Its in the middle of a bustling restaurant and shopping district but is surprisingly quiet. Rob himself was very responsive and a great host. I would definitely come back here for sure. Make sure you take advantage of the $20/day parking that Rob offers. It was a lifesaver.,1.0
Chicago,"My experience could not have been better. This was the mog immaculate, stylish, modern, and comfortable AirBnB experience I've ever had. The owner has spared no expense, from stainless steel alliances to remodeled bathrooms and showers, to new wood flooring. The temper-pedic bed was heavenly, and the furnishings were modern and comfortable. The attention to detail was unparalleled, from train maps and restaurant guides to Chicago artwork and plenty of cooking utensils and supplies, as well as beauty and hygiene products. I was beyond impressed with the level of care and consideration.   When I return to Chicago in the future, this will be my first choice. Always.",1.0
Chicago,We were In Chicago to see Hamilton and sightsee with our teenaged daughter. We loved this location and neighborhood. It felt safe and there were tons of nearby places to eat or get groceries. The condo itself was extremely clean and was well stocked with necessities. It was spacious and we never felt crowded. Rob was a great host and was very responsive to our questions. It was a plus to have  parking available as we never moved our car until we left Chicago. I would definitely rent from Rob again,1.0
Chicago,"Rob's place is incredibly stylish, supremely located, and overall provides a comfortable, beautiful perch from which to explore the city of Chicago.

Chicago,"This place is a fantastic stay!  Everything is wonderfully decorated, well thought-out, very clean, and it has an authenticity you can only find in a beautiful historic building.  The location is great as well. It’s a 13 minute drive to downtown Chicago, and 500 feet from the best breakfast place in town “Whisk”. You must go there!  Only thing missing in the Airbnb was coffee, so you may want to bring your own. But they have multiple ways to make it if you do.  Great stay, highly recommend this Airbnb!",1.0
Chicago,My wife and I came in to Chicago for our wedding anniversary and are so glad we chose to stay with Rob.  Probably the best Airbnb experience we’ve had.  He really thinks of everything and we can’t recommend staying here enough.,1.0

Chicago,"By far-this Rob's place is the most STUNNING home my husband and I stayed in. The décor is stylish, modern and pure class. The Holiday decorations made it festive and cozy. I really want those flocked trees!! LOL Absolutely gorgeous. The pictures of this listing does it NO JUSTICE!! Rob is a delight and one of thee most gracious hosts I have encountered. His level of hospitality is unparalleled and he gave us some great suggestions of local eateries in the area. His home is in great proximity to downtown and other neighborhoods. We truly could not be more pleased and dreaded leaving to return back to our home state. However, we will certainly be back and definitely in the process of making plans to book Rob's home again. You will not be disappointed!! Truly his home is a GEM!!!",1.0
Chicago,"The warmest home we've ever been in. Sparkling clean, modern and superb interior design, great location and a very lovely, warm host. Thank you, Rob and we promise to only stay at your place whenever we're in Chicago! An experience to remember!",1.0
Chicago,"This was the cleanest Airbnb we’ve ever stayed in. If you are picky with finding a clean place that actually FEELS clean, this home is for you. You can immediately tell that Rob takes pride in his apartment and everything is so well maintained and stylishly decorated. The bed was a welcomed place for rest after a long day, and we loved how firm the mattress was and how fluffy the pillows were—very comfortable.  The amenities were spot on, the coffeemaker, the gas stove, plenty of dishes and quality cookware to use for making a meal. Not mention, the exceptional decor of the entire apartment! The location was excellent and walkable to numerous local restaurants and bars (a few were literally steps from the apartment door). We loved being on the third floor and always felt super safe. There is some traffic noise that can be heard in the bedroom, but Rob provides earplugs for light sleepers. In truth, we actually enjoyed being lulled to sleep by the sounds of the city and it didn’t bother us at all. The convenience of the grocery store being a 5 minute walk away made buying some pantry and fridge essentials easy. The couch in the living room was super comfy and perfect for relaxing and watching the Thanksgiving Day parade and some Netflix Christmas movies. This was the perfect Airbnb and we were highly impressed (not always easy). 5 stars to Rob for such an amazingly clean, comfortable, stylish, and well thought out home away from home. We’ll be back soon!",1.0
Chicago,"This place is so much nicer in person! And wow the bed was so comfortable we ended up sleeping the first night we got there instead of going out because we got trapped in the bed lol. Communicating with Rob was very easy and his home was supplied with everything!! First aid kit, make up remover wipes you name it lol. The home is in a very quiet and safe neighborhood. Would definitely stay again, one of the nicest places I have ever stayed!",1.0
Chicago,"We had a short but wonderful stay at Rob's place for a weekend trip to Chicago. Communication and check-in were quick and easy, and it was a breeze to get there from the airport on the train and a bus.  The space was spotlessly clean and beautifully furnished, with thoughtful touches that made our stay really comfortable. The location is great too, with a grocery store nearby and lots of good food/drink options as well.  Our only regrets are that we didn't stay here longer to enjoy it more and that we had to catch a Sunday morning flight before we could peruse the beautiful store downstairs some more. We would definitely stay here again, and will happily recommend it to any family and friends who may be looking for a place to stay in Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"Rob’s apartment was exactly what we need for a wonderful stay in Chicago. It was styled beautifully and Rob provided everything we could possibly need- thought of everything!

Chicago,"This might be my favorite Airbnb stay to date. The apartment so stunning, clean, and comfortable and charming Ukrainian Village with so much to offer, we chose to make fewer trips into the heart of the city to spend more time enjoying and exploring the immediate surroundings both in and out of the apartment. Yoga, restaurants, shops, grocery...everything within walking distance and this little oasis to temporarily call home. Rob couldn’t have been a better host. Will be back for sure!",1.0
Chicago,Rob’s place was amazing. Right in the center of everything. The location was close to many restaurants and bars. It is also a short ride to surrounding neighborhoods and downtown. The place itself was amazing with all the amenities needed for a great stay. Rob was prompt in his communication and was right below if needed. The parking space was a bonus as it is hard to find parking in this neighborhood without a permit.,1.0
Chicago,"Location, atmosphere, beautiful decor, every thought to amenities (even a First Aid Kit!)... you simply can't go wrong with this great condo in Ukrainian Village.  It was a snowy weekend so we especially enjoyed the cabinet full of games!  We were visiting family in Streeterville and getting there was no problem at all.  Rob greeted us when I arrived, and check-out was very simple.  Also, my brother drove over from a neighboring city to meet me, so we appreciated the off-street parking for him and his daughter.  Stay with Rob!  You won't regret it.",1.0
Chicago,"This is a stylish, modern yet comfortable apartment located in a cool part of town with lots of options to dine and a young at heart hip vibe.  I felt like a movie star in the surroundings & was happy to find out that the amazing shop below actually sold some of the items that are featured in the living space.

Very clean and in a great location. 10/10 would recommend!",1.0
Chicago,"This was our first AirBNB and I gave 5 stars all the way through. Chris was an amazing host. Quick responses and clear communication. Super helpful with us as we learned to navigate city, food and parking. Being from a rural area, we were grateful to have the help! Maps on fridge. Nice residential area, felt safe even at night. Extremely clean. Special touches such as video games and snacks. Went above and beyond to provide a welcoming and safe environment. Room was stylized, modern. Plenty of amenities, even access to laundry. If we make our way back to town, we’ll stay here again. Thank you for making our first AirBNB memorable!",1.0
Chicago,"Great place to stay! Very clean and convenient to food and shops! Reminded me of being Ina little apartment. The shower was a bit small, so if you're a larger person it may be difficult to fit. But it was a very nice place and the host were quick to respond.",1.0

Chicago,"We absolutely loved our say in Christopher's place. While it is a basement space, it has all the privacy you need including your own entrance. The decor is fantastic and we loved many of the little touches including the board games, tasteful art, game systems, and the water and drinks in the fridge were a welcome surprise after our evening arrival. Having central heat as well as a space heater in the unit helped make sure we stayed nice and toasty during our visit. We didn't take advantage of them, but the fact that a washer and dryer were available was a nice bonus.   We'll definitely look here first on our next trip to Chicago!",1.0

Chicago,"What a gem! Christopher’s place was exactly as described including a ton of extras. Christopher was quick to respond before and during my stay. He left a light on for me the night I arrived since I had a super late flight. He even checked in on me the next day to make sure I had everything I needed. The place was totally spotless. The bed was very comfy and there were tons of extra pillows. The kitchen was fully equipped and he even stocked it with several quick food items. These were much appreciated especially the first morning. The space felt so much more roomy than I was expecting. Ceilings are a bit lower being a garden unit but I had no problem at all with it. The water pressure in the shower was really great. Christopher made a really detailed welcome guide with lots of great info abt the neighborhood. The studio is only 3 short blocks away from a bus that takes you directly to the belmont el station (abt a 20-30 min ride). I felt very safe in the neighborhood (family vibe) even when coming in using transit late at night by myself. If you are wanting to do a lot of things in the Loop, transit took me 45-hour sometimes depending on the time of day. This was not a big deal for me bc I wanted a neighborhood experience vs more of a downtown touristy one, but it did take longer to get to and from. Lastly, Christopher was kind enough to  hold my luggage for me on my last day since I had a later flight. All in all, fantastic experience and I highly recommend this listing. Thank you so much, Christopher!",1.0
Chicago,Christopher’s place was was everything I could have hoped for. It was a nice cozy place where my girlfriend and I felt immediately at home.

Chicago,This is such a great place to stay! Awesome location between the airport and downtown. Uber’s were always there within 5 minutes and were reasonably priced for a ride to anywhere in the city.

Transportation was nearby and made our rides to the city very convinient, also we got to explore more of it by using transportation.

Chicago,Chris was an amazing host.  His place was very clean and better than we expected.  This was the wife’s first time visiting Chicago and she wasn’t disappointed as this place offers a lot of space for two guests.  Parking on the same street was hit and miss but that can be expected for a big city.  We took Lyft anytime we were visiting downtown Chicago.  It was nice to come and go as we pleased.  Chris responded very quickly to any messages that were sent.  I felt safe enough walking in the general neighborhood.  When we visit Chicago again this would definitely be the first choice.  Our first host cancelled which brought us to finding this gem.,1.0

Chicago,"Samantha’s place was perfect for our short stay! It was very clean, stylish and cozy. The small, secluded patio was a sweet surprise. Only things to note- the stairs are very steep and the neighbors have a puppy, which was loud when we came in after a concert during quiet hours. Check in instructions were thorough and easy! We would love to stay again.",1.0
Chicago,"Samantha's apartment was clean, cozy, and had great lighting. She was kind enough to let us store our luggage when we arrived early. We slept comfortably and were within walking distance to a lot of restaurants, bars, and the concert venue we attended. We had a great time and would love to stay there again.",1.0
Chicago,"Samantha’s place is modern cute chic. Every piece of furniture is well thought out with aesthetic and function in mind. The steps to the loft bedroom: first, it’s very roomy up there and cozy. The steps itself could be problematic for people who are afraid of heights but for someone like me who is uncoordinated, it was surprisingly easy to navigate. Although, I didn’t need anything, Samantha made me feel like she was only an email/text/phone call away if I needed assistance or info. Also, there’s a small but very cute balcony where u can enjoy your morning coffee.",1.0
Chicago,Fun spot to serve as base camp to explore Chicago as you can reach a bunch of fun neighborhoods inside of 30 min. The unit itself was extremely clean and Samantha was super responsive. The lock box makes check in and out simple. Added touches like the full kitchen and French press are a bonus. ,1.0
Chicago,"I had a great stay at Samantha's. The space was lovely and very clean. I didnt spend much time here because I like to explore when I visit a new place, but I appreciated the relaxing and simple vibe of the space at the end of a long day. Samantha and I communicated via text and I found her to be very kind and accommodating regarding a specific inquiry that I had. If you're looking and this place is free, book it now!",1.0
Chicago,"Samantha's place was the perfect place to explore logan square, we used to live in the city and hadn't done much exploring there.

We got awesome suggestions on places to eat and drink and it doesn't take too long to get into the city. 10/10 would recommend!!",1.0
Chicago,"Samantha & Jonathan's loft was exactly as pictured, and located in a convenient location. I loved the apartment - I would love to live here myself! The stairs to the loft was quite steep as others describe, and I left my suitcase downstairs and only went upstairs to sleep. The bed was very comfortable. My friend whom I stayed with wanted an easy access to the bathroom during night, so she decided to use the air mattress downstairs, which we found in the closet (we moved furnitures around to make space). The walk to the California CTA station was 15-20 min for me, but since it was quite a cold week, I often opted for Uber. As we had packed plans in downtown, we did not get to explore much of the neighborhood nor get to ask for neighborhood tips that Samantha was happy to share, but I'd love to come back to this loft and explore more!",1.0
Chicago,"The loft is located in a great quiet spot that is walking distance from great restaurants and bars. It was a ~15 minute walk from both the Logan Square and California blue line stops, and extremely close to tons and tons of good restaurants and bars (check out Lula, Giant, and Longman & Eagle). Samantha was a great host and the place was spotless when we arrived, with tea and some nice snacks sitting on the table. Checking in and out was as easy and quick as it gets, and we appreciated Samantha periodically messaging us to check on our experience. We would stay here again in a heartbeat. Our only warning is that all the stairs in the building are extremely steep and narrow. We didn't have any problems, but you should be careful. Overall a 5/5 experience.",1.0
Chicago,"The space is exactly as pictured.  Simple, basic, perfect for one or two people.  The bed in the loft was comfortable and the HDTV had plenty of premium channels.  The neighborhood is quiet and we felt safe.  Parking on the street wasn't an issue for us, but it did seem to be full in the evening.  Major bus line is 3 blocks away that will take you straight to the northside Fullerton train stops and the Blue Line station that goes to the loop is about 8 blocks away.  The host is easily reached and communication was great.  Thanks!",1.0
Chicago,"I enjoyed my stay in this space! The studio itself was very clean and quiet during sleeping hours. The staircase to the bed was a little steeper than I had expected, but it was sturdy and I got used to it. It was in a lovely location that had access to buses and trains. I did do a bit of walking, but that was my choice. Samantha and Jonathan were quick with communication and gave suggestions for the area. I would stay again. Thanks!",1.0

We would definitely stay here again. Thank you!",1.0
Chicago,"Samantha's place is absolutely marvelous! It's located in a nice residential area, with some fun bars and restaurants in the neighborhood. If you don't want to wait for a bus, it's a bit of a walk to the blue line, but nothing bad. Uber rides into the city were not that expensive and an easy way to get into the city. The apartment itself is really, really nice. Clean, spacious and an extremely comfy bed. I would highly recommend it to anybody!",1.0
Chicago,A very stylish flat with lots of complimentary toiletries and helpful guide books for the area. The flat isn’t in the city centre but taking an Uber carpool is a cheap and easy way of getting into the main part.,1.0
Chicago,This is a beautifully-designed loft apartment in an upmarket part of town.  It is sparkling clean and has some nice touches such as local coffee. Communication with Samantha was very smooth and she answered our questions quickly.  I would highly recommend staying here in Chicago.,1.0
Chicago,"Lovely apartment in a great area of the city.  Local amenities were perfect (I'd recommend Tony's for any grocery requirement and Wyler Road for a chilled drink and a bit to eat!) and not too far from the ""L"" to the Loop where it's a 20 min ride in.   Hosts were great and very responsive to any request and requirement we had and helped out as much as possible.  The stairs up to the mezzanine are definitely steep but we expected this from the description so not a problem at all and the apartment is carefully thought out to give maximum usability of the space.  Overall a fantastic expperience of this amazing city.",1.0
Chicago,"Place was amazing! My boyfriend and I absolutely loved our stay here in this loft. Area is very clean and very stylish. All of our questions were answered very fast and accurately. Everything was supplied for us, they even had Q-tips lol. ",1.0
Chicago,"We had an amazing stay at Samantha's place. It is located in a quiet neighborhood within 20min walking distance from the blue line. The apartment is spacious and has everything you need including cooking facilities, big comfortable bed, tv etc. We were a bit delayed and arrived late in the evening, but Samantha was extremely kind by helping us ordering pizza while we were absolutely wrecked from traveling. Furthermore, she always responded very quickly to questions from us. We ran in to her husband Jonathan a couple of times who was also super friendly and gave us a ton of advice on what to do in the city. Overall we had a great couple of days in Chicago and we definitely recommend this place! ",1.0
Chicago,"Samantha's place was perfect for our weekend getaway. Travel around the city was very convenient with transit and biking options very closeby. The space was extremely tidy and comfortable, and our hosts were very accommodating...thanks for a wonderful Chicago experience!",1.0
Chicago,"This apartment is great! The apartment itself is already beautiful and special with its high ceilings, and the location is also very nice. In walking distance from Logan square, with nice coffee bars, restaurants, shops and street art. But also in walking distance from public transport that takes you to downtown in just a few stops. We would definitely recommend this place for a great visit to this great city",1.0
Chicago,"Lovely loft studio, spotlessly clean and very well designed with everything we needed. Location is good with the metro about 15 mins walk away then 20 mins to downtown, and a Chicago bike scheme station 5mins away and an even quicker cycle to downtown. We also enjoyed the 606 trail, Chicago's answer to the Highline which is also close by.  So a great place and a great location.",1.0
Chicago,Beautiful apartment in quite neighborhood. The space is great it's location relative to public transit is awesome. Samantha was quick to respond to any questions. I will definitely be checking availability next time I'm back in Chicago.,1.0
Chicago,"We had a great stay at Logan Square. The appartment was spacious (more so than we expected) and very clean with thoughtful provisions provided.   Samantha and Jonathon provided us with a great list of nearby places do eat and drink (from fresh coffee to pizza) and were very helpful in communicating when we asked for help.   Logan Sqaure itself is a lovely leafy neighbourhood around half an hr from Downtown on the train. There's plenty of amenities a short walk from the appartment, as well as loads of great bars. A taxi into Downtown is quicker but more expensive.   The 'L' (elevated train) is a 15-20 min walk from the appt and then a further 15 min or so ride into downtown where there is plenty to do. A weekly ticket for the train is around $30 and gives you access to trains and buses. Very handy for getting around as the bus and L system is easy to use.  On a clear day, we would recommend hiring a bike and taking the Lake Shore route which runs alongside Lake Michigan. You get stunning views of the iconic skyscrapers from across the water.  Hancock Tower on a clear day is also a must see too, with great views for miles.  If the weather is cooler, then there are loads of great museums to visit. the History of Chicago by Lincoln Park is great. The Old Town is nearby for a drink afterwards too.  Definitely a great city to visit with lots to do, and a great appartment in a great neighbourhood. 10/10  Thanks",1.0
Chicago,"The apartment was lovely, clean, and the coffee/snacks were appreciated. The security within the apartment was great, and although the surrounding area was less confidence-inspiring, she had us send a photo of our car once we arrived, and the area had cameras, so it put me at ease. We were super close to both bus and train options that we utilized several times, and within walking distance of target for quick pick-ups. We enjoyed our stay!",1.0
Chicago,"Kay is the best superhost you will ever have!! She is great with communication and is very welcoming! Her apartment has a home-like feeling that will make your vacation even better. Cleanest place ever!! Absolutely spotless and smells amazing!!  If you are looking for suggestions of where to eat and shop, Kay will give you a list of her favorite places and provides a variety brochures, pamphlets, flyers, and food menu’s! I had mentioned my family was vegan and she gave me options of food choices around the area!  Great location!!! I highly recommend staying at Kay’s place if you are visiting Chicago!!",1.0
Chicago,"Kay’s place was very cute and clean!! She was super quick to respond to anything. The train is a quick walk from the apartment though I don’t think I would personally feel safe walking from the train tooo late at night as a young lady. Loved how she  had treats available like bananas, it’s, orange juice, coffee. It is very convenient for a quick trip to downtown Chicago!",1.0
Chicago,"Even though Kay's place was more on the south side of Chicago and I was going to the north side for a Cubs game, her place was great for a one-night stay with how reasonably priced it was right before Memorial Day weekend. I just got ubers to get to and from the game rather than public transit. Kay's place was very comfortable and she was a great host!",1.0
Chicago,"Kay’s place was amazing! Such thoughtful, kind touches, and Kay is super communicative. Seriously, this room was nicer and more well-equipped than some of the luxury hotel’s I’ve stayed at. 100% would stay here again!",1.0
Chicago,"From the extreme cleanliness of the apartment to the added extras everywhere you turn, this place was absolutely perfect! The host is respectful and generous with the most friendly senior kitty ever! Coming “home” to a snuggly feline in the living room was probably the best thing ever (I’m an extreme cat person). However, if you’re not into cats, no worries; the cat isn’t pushy and you could probably spend your entire trip ~not~ seeing him if that’s more your style. The off-street parking was clean and safe, something that can be hard to secure in Chicago. The apartment is located very close to both the train and the bus, making in-city traveling quite easy. I would highly recommend this AirBnB!",1.0
Chicago,It’s a wonderful and comfortable place to stay. Kay is really great at communicating with guests and is super nice and welcoming. The space is very clean and has a nice charm to it. We only stayed for one night but I definitely will keep this place in mind if I ever make it up to Chicago again.,1.0
Chicago,I extremely enjoyed my stay at Kay's place.  The location is perfect. My favorite part was having a Target with a Starbucks and market near by. This place is also closely located to a CTA and the freeway entrance if you have a car.  Kay provides many good ameneties and I was very happy for that. She is quickly responsive and super helpful. I'm glad I got to meet her. She is a sweet person.  It is 15 min away from the city.    Also if you have a rental/car there is parking near by!!!  Thanks Kay,1.0
Chicago,"Five stars isn’t enough! Kay made me feel very welcome and comfortable. I felt as if I was staying with family or an old friend, definitely not a stranger. She provided breakfast and coffee for me before I headed out and it definitely gave me a great start. I have a cat at my place, so their friendly lil guy made me feel even more at home. I would definitely recommend her to anyone else and will definitely stay with her again if the opportunity arises.",1.0
Chicago,"I was pleasantly surprised by how amazing the experience turned out to be at Kay's home. The entire house felt inviting and immediately puts you at ease. She puts the guest first and it shows in her thoughtful approach to outfitting the room. From soft bath towels and a loofah at your bedside, to the coffee and tea bar in the kitchen for hot drinks in the morning. She really wants you to feel like you are taken care of the moment you walk in the door. The location is convenient with good selection of restaurants in the area to choose from and downtown is a hop and a skip away for those who want to take in the sights. If it isn't obvious already,  I highly recommend staying with Kay during your trip to Chicago!",1.0
Chicago,"I stayed at Kay's place with two of my friends over St. Pat's weekend. The free parking was a huge blessing, and the apartment was very close to the CTA for local travel. The apartment itself was clean and well-kept. Kay was a wonderful host! From giving us travel recommendations to providing some St. Patrick's day accessories, she made our stay as enjoyable as possible. We also enjoyed helping ourselves to the coffee bar and playing with her adorable cat. All of our expectations for our stay were far exceeded and I would gladly stay here again.",1.0

Chicago,"Kay was a perfect host. She went out of her way to make sure I was comfortable and ensured I had everything I needed. Her place is so cute and even offers a breakfast bar with coffee, snacks and breakfast foods. She even left a loofa, towels and washcloths for me with chocolates. Also, there were loads of local brochures and magazines to browse. Her 16 year old cat Toby is such a love! He was super friendly and sweet. It was raining on the day I was going out to adventure in the city and I Kay was so cool about lending me her umbrella. She’s a kind soul and was so helpful with local tips for eats and getting around. Highly recommend staying at Kay’s!",1.0
Chicago,"Kay provided a great Airbnb! She was prompt in her responses and provided a few extra touches that made our stay very welcoming (water bottles in the room's mini-fridge, clear and prompt communication, breakfast items (although we skipped out on those), well-labeled instructions outside the door on how to get in as well as within the house to make things very clear, etc.)",1.0
Chicago,"Best Airbnb I've stayed in!

Chicago,Kay is an Amazing host with an air bnb that makes you feel at home! The entire house is sparkling clean and full of creative and cute decor. This room is spacious and fully furnished with all the amenities you may need. The check-in/out is simple with thorough instructions. The el (CTA train) is a short 5min walk in a safe neighborhood. This is the second time I’ve stayed here and both times there were other guests yet it was very quiet and comfortable stay and rest. Respect this space as it truly is a gem!,1.0
Chicago,Great stay. Kay’s place was in a great location close to downtown and public transportation. The room and bathroom were very clean and had nice touches.

The apartment and room were cozy and I felt like being at home during my stay, with access to kitchen and living room area. The cat is super friendly too!   Kay as a person was a nice host. She even gave me some medicine upon request, as I was catching some cold from the weather in Chicago.   If I ever come back to Chicago I have a reliable place to stay :)",1.0
Chicago,"Kay is an absolute pro of a host.  She communicated check-in instructions very clearly and regularly  touched-base to make sure I had everything I needed during my stay.  Her place is ideally situated a mere 5 minute walk from an L train station (which is a fantastic way to get around Chicago as I discovered).  Very comfortable, clean, and safe place to spend your nights when visiting Chicago-- can't recommend enough.",1.0
Chicago,"The misfortune of staying at Kay's is that one will quickly realize that not every host will be like her! :-/ I was able to take the train (as she pre-stay suggested) directly out of midway and walk about 2 blocks & if cleanliness is next to godliness, then trust Kay has you covered. And to be completely honest, Kay extended herself to me in an act that goes way beyond the scope of AirBnb. I was comfortable, I felt safe, the room was very dedicated. Being that she was my 1st AirBnb experience,  I really feel like I lucked up. Omg, and her snack bar (fresh yummies), were too delish! :-* #BookHer",1.0
Chicago,"Kay is a fantastic host and I can not recommend her enough. When we contacted her for anything we needed, the response was lightning-fast! She was courteous and made her home warm and inviting for her guests. She really took a burden off our shoulders while planning a last-minute trip to Chicago. If you’re looking for a great experience for a really reasonable price, definitely book with Kay!",1.0
Chicago,"If I could give 6 stars I would. Kay's place was immaculate, cute, comfortable, easy to access — everything you could ask for in an Airbnb. Kay herself is an excellent and hospitable host, helping us out with umbrellas, breakfast, sunscreen, loofas — all the little things that shows she truly cares about making her guests' experience as amazing as possible. She is a gracious and generous person and I would 100% stay at her property again. ",1.0
Chicago,"If you don't like stairs or cats, that is the only reason not to stay here. Location is good, ample parking & light outdoors- ammenities are top & Kay is an awesome host with a BIG heart for her aging cat- that alone should make her 1st choice for any cat lover.",1.0
Chicago,Kay's place was absolutely amazing. She was a perfect host and made my vacation feel so comfortable. I was traveling alone and one late night she even messaged me to make sure I was ok.

The room itself is spacious and comfortable, sitting in what amounts to its own wing of the house (which is large, inviting, and beautiful). The neighborhood was great; I never had an issue with parking and it's walking distance to countless great spots regardless. I highly, highly recommend everyone stay here!",1.0

Quick and easy access to downtown, via or the pubs/restaurants of the area via train, or bus. Nice map of the neighbourhood in the room. There is so much to see and do in Chicago, stay a while!

On more than one night, we decided to stay in (rather than go out) just so we could enjoy the fire, movie, selection, and some homemade pasta!

As it was February in Chicago, we loved the fireplace to keep the space nice and warm. The flat was very clean, and stocked with towels and products for the shower. Danielle gave us a mega list of recommendations ahead of time, which was super helpful and full of cool restaurants and bars. The apartment is in Logan Square, and while we spent a good deal of time there and in places like Wicker Park, the freezing weather had us in lots of Uber’s downtown as well — just something to keep in mind. Though, it’s also off a subway line. Overall, no complaints, and Danielle’s communication was amazing. Would definitely recommend.",1.0

Chicago,This was a truly desperate search for a safe place for my daughter to stay last minute while out of town.  She made last minute plans to travel to Chicago for the Gold Cup soccer match.  Once there she could not find a hotel to rent to her because she is 18.  She was in her car crying.  I booked with Jim on the internet and spoke with him by phone.  He was so great!!!  He met her and her boyfriend at the door.  He even spoke Spanish with her boyfriend which made him feel great.  He assured me by phone about how safe the neighborhood  was and that he would be on the premises just a moments notice away.  He treated them like adults but still helped me feel comfortable about their safety knowing they will always be my babies.  It was truly above and beyond.  And my daughter said the apartment was gorgeous.,1.0

Chicago,"Had a great stay, I️ checked in sooner and they gave me no problem, I️ was greeted as soon as I️ got there and given a welcome and was told they were staying in the same building so I️f I️ needed anything to ask, also gave me background on the neighborhood. The apt is so clean, very stylish and cozy. And the neighborhood is super safe with free parking!! The hosts were friendly and attentive to us. We really enjoyed our stay.",1.0
Chicago,"The location of this property could not be in a better place in Chicago! We felt like we hit the Airbnb Lotto! Such an amazingly diverse, safe clean and welcoming neighborhood! the apartment was beautiful and absolutely spotless I've never seen anything so clean! Jim was amazing! I could not have asked for a better experience!",1.0
Chicago,"Our stay in Chicago was great and we really enjoyed staying in Andersonville. It was far enough away to be quiet but only a 12-15 minute walk to the train station, which we didn’t mind at all. The neighborhood felt safe enough to walk in and we liked the local coffee shops and restaurants.   The apartment was nicely decorated and clean. I would just give a heads up that if you’re a light sleeper you can hear the hosts upstairs because it’s an old building. I would never take away a star for this because it’s just a personal thing. My wife is a heavy sleeper and it never bothered her but I had to download a white noise app on my phone to fall asleep.   The hosts were great communicators and asked if we needed anything and how our stay was going. We both enjoyed it and would stay here again!",1.0
Chicago,"Jim's place is just as pictured and described and was a lovely, comfortable, clean and quiet place to stay while I visited family and friends in the Chicago area. The location is halfway between the main city and Evanston, which was perfect for me, and it was very close to some really cool restaurants/bakeries, etc. Had no trouble getting around and found parking on the street each night without trouble. Safe and quiet neighborhood. Jim and Maximo were very attentive and had supplied everything I needed for my stay. Would definitely stay there again.",1.0
Chicago,This place is as advertised or better. Superhosts and great amenities. Secure neighborhood and a beautiful apartment make this a great place to stay when you’re in Chicago.

Chicago,"Jim's place was FANTASTIC. The place was exactly what we expected it to be from the fabulous photos which were 100% accurate showing off the truly lovely and well decorated apartment. Very clean, well appointed, extra towels and pillows, fantastic magazines for relaxing reading, GREAT map of the local neighborhood in order to find fantastic local shops and places to eat.  You can totally get around on public transit (mostly CTA Bus) from this apartment. Note: the place is a little far from the CTA train stations into downtown. We rented a car and really appreciated the flexibility to get around the city easily and great neighborhood street parking.   The apartment is well appointed with everything you need for your stay. One of the bedrooms is street facing but there is not much traffic so it stayed very quiet at night. Air conditioning for the summer time is a huge plus on muggy hot days!  Andersonville neighborhood is one of my favorite areas of Chicago. It is quaint, full of local  charm, great eats and drinks within walking distance, and a fantastic way to get a feel of what real Chicago is like (and not the fake touristy stuff). Off the beaten path geek thing we did - we drove to and walked through the nearby Rosehill Cemetery Mausoleum. The old original section has a substantial collection of LC Tiffany stained glass windows and walking the completely silent hallways to see the sun shining through these beautiful windows is pretty awesome if you like that sort of thing.  Love Jim's place! Beyond 5 stars! We will hopefully be back to town and rent out his apartment again in the future. ",1.0
Chicago,"Great space to spend a few days. Neighborhood was a few miles north of the downtown area of Chicago. Very quiet but still had the Chicago city feel to it.

So you guys are very nice  and  your hospitality goes beyond  what words can describe .  I know  past experiences  that Airbnb have change my life on how I stay in a city or a place of my travels keep up the good work.  So your place very  amazing  it’s worth every penny that I spend.

Chicago,"The apartment was beautiful with 2 comfortable beds, with the bedrooms on opposite ends of the unit from each other.  A very short walk (few short blocks) from downtown Andersonville with all of it's shops and restaurants, with a farmers market every Wednesday. Beautiful area to walk around. I'd recommend it to anyone looking to stay in the area.",1.0
Chicago,"Jim and Maximo were great hosts! This spacious two-bed, one-bath is the perfect getaway for family and friends! I picked Andersonville, because it's a great LGBTQ+ friendly neighborhood and was a great location to experience all of the Pride festivities happening over the weekend during our stay. Jim and Maximo were super responsive and very accommodating throughout my entire experience even before arriving for the weekend! The neighborhood is a family-friendly area and was very walk-able with lots of places to go for food, coffee or to go grocery shopping. The apartment was very spacious, clean and had lots of cute touches/decorations to make the place feel like home. I will definitely look to stay here again in the future during my next visit to Chicago!",1.0

Chicago,"This place was phenomenal. It was just as pictured, the location is awesome to the city we visited, both hosts handled any/all things we needed/checked up on us, and all of our necessities were met and beyond. This was a very pleasurable stay and I would definitely recommend this place to friends if they ever come visit Chicago.   You have everything you need within a short walk and if you really need to, there’s a Target .7 miles from the place. Close eating and bar spots within a short walk. It takes about 20-30 min to get into Chicago.   Awesome visit and great hosts.",1.0
Chicago,"Jim & Maximo we’re outstanding hosts. Every detail of this beautiful apartment was lovely. The location was great for our stay in north Chicago.

Chicago,"Loved Jim and Maximo’s place, it was very spacious, clean and stylish. I enjoyed looking through the magazines and the beds were extremely comfortable.

We would definitely stay again upon a return visit to Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"We really enjoyed staying at Jim's place over a quick weekend get-away to Chicago. It's very close to all the Andersonville shops and restaurants on Clark St. and a short walk to the el stop to go downtown; it's in a lovely, quiet, leafy neighborhood of brownstones. Parking was easy -- there was street parking right outside the apartment; we parked the car when we arrived Friday and didn't need to move it or use it until we left on Sunday. The apartment was very clean and well-appointed, with a great kitchen and nice amenities. Jim was there to give us the keys when we checked in; he and Maximo were available if needed but also gave us space. We'd highly recommend this one!",1.0
Chicago,"Stylish apartment in a great location with convenient parking and great restaurants/shops nearby. We really enjoyed our stay here. The kitchen had everything we needed to cook and prepare our own food. Jim was very responsive and accommodating, which made everything easy and enjoyable. I wish that we could have controlled the heat ourselves, but when the apartment started to get a bit chilly, we notified Jim, and he was able to turn on the heat for us quickly. Overall a great space and great experience!",1.0
Chicago,"Jim’s place is aesthetically pleasing, clean, and comfortable. It is in the lovely neighborhood of Andersonville and accessible to many restaurants and shops. I appreciated the clear communication, quick responses, ease of check in, and helpfulness when I needed to extend my stay. The house is well equipped with the conveniences and thoughtful touches that are helpful to a busy business traveler- a high quality iron and real ironing board, a washer and drier, toiletries, coffee etc.I would definitely stay at Jim’s place again.",1.0
Chicago,"We loved staying here! The place was beautiful, with many nice touches, a charming older building but remodelled with modern amenities, and sparkling clean. Getting in was very convenient, there were snacks left there for us to enjoy, parking on the street was easy, and Jim and Maximo always responded immediately to all of our queries, plus checked in to see if we wanted coffee, or needed anything else from them, checked on the comfort of the beds, and generally made sure that we had a great stay and felt well cared for. The kitchen is well appointed - the only thing not available was a microwave, but Maximo commented that he's about to get one for the apartment so that can be expected soon.  This is a great apartment with caring and involved hosts. I recommend staying here unconditionally!",1.0
Chicago,"The apartment was beautiful and very spacious. There are restaurants, grocery stores and pharmacies within walking distance. The neighborhood seemed very safe and we enjoyed walking around even in the cold weather. The Keurig and snack basket were nice touches which we appreciated. The beds were  too firm to be comfortable for me, but my boyfriend was fine with it, so it may be personal preference. Jim and Maximo were very attentive and always ready to help. Please note, the apartment does not have a microwave. Also, there is a policy that you cannot have any guest enter into the apartment (not just for sleeping, but for visiting too) which I misunderstood when booking, but it was not a problem since it was only the two of us. If you're traveling in a group or with family staying in other places, you may want to look for another place if you want them to be able to visit you. Overall our stay was lovely and we would recommend this apartment.",1.0
Chicago,"Location, location, location! The spot is located in a beautiful historic neighbourhood filled with lots of charm, great shops, and fantastic restaurants within walking distance.

Chicago,"This was my second stay at Ellie’s place, and I maintain that it’s one of the best Airbnbs ever! So quiet, clean, stylish, and comfortable. The tub is awesome and the coffee’s great, what more could I ask for?",1.0
Chicago,"Place was great! Clean, cozy, great location. Check in & out went seamlessly. LOVED the bathtub and shower. I would definitely recommend. The TV package was a surprising plus.. not usually one to hang out too much at a bnb- but after a day of drinking at Wrigley we were feeling a little rough-  it was so nice to just chill out the next day watching movies and ordering food! Loved it!",1.0
Chicago,"As a single traveler the studio set up was perfect for me. The location was great, since I had just been staying downtown at a conference prior to my stay it was nice to get out a bit and see some other neighborhoods. I could easily walk to the 606 Trail - which I really enjoyed - and N Milwaukee Ave for some fun shopping. I appreciated the guide they had in the studio with local recommendations listed, I got take-out from the Indian place down the street and it was delicious. Very comfortable bed!",1.0

Chicago,"I absolutely loved this place! I already told my sister that when we get the chance to go to Chicago together we will absolutely have to stay there. It was the perfect size and had everything I needed. The style of the whole place was gorgeous. I can tell a lot of thought went into creating this space. The shower and bathtub were amazing, and it was very helpful that there was a hair dryer, shampoo/conditioner, body wash, etc. When I do get the chance to travel to Chicago again I hope this is available. I can’t say enough about how much I loved this place!",1.0

Chicago,"What can I say except that Elinor’s place was great! The little touches, such as welcome beers, pour over coffee, books on Chicago, and available toilet trees (we flew in and only had carry-one) were perfect. We only used the room for sleeping since we spent most of our day and night exploring the city! The weather is Chicago sure is unpredictable and crazy, so make sure you have a jacket or umbrella on stand by! Haha Thank you again for allowing us to stay in your lovely place!",1.0

Chicago,"If I had more a sense of self-interest, I would write the  worst review ever so that this amazing space is always available for me when I'm in Chicago. First: it is it's own little building in the city. Wow! It's designed so beautifully, I took tons of photos to inspire my guest house back in CT. Elinor was responsive, accommodating, and super nice. I'm spreading the word to all of my friends who are jazzed staying there. The location is 10-12 minutes from downtown... well worth it for these gorgeous accommodations. BTW: the photos don't really capture the details and inviting sweetness of the place. I'll see you again, Elinor!",1.0
Chicago,"Ellie and Devin's space is charming! It's a well-designed, well-maintained large studio with incredibly thoughtful touches: books about the history of Chicago, more books from Chicago based writers and poets, games, postcards, and even stamps. I was a little nervous the first night with the studio being so close to the street, but I slept like a dream – the bed is comfortable and the studio is airy and bright. The place is exactly as pictured, even better. Ellie and Devin were very responsive and helpful. I would definitely come back and highly recommend staying here.",1.0

Chicago,"I can’t say it enough- this is THE best Airbnb I’ve ever stayed at and is so cozy! It’s worth every penny! I came to take my boards and it was just perfect for the stay. It’s so stylish, quaint, adorable neighborhood, and the little touches are unlimited! There was wine and beer stocked in the fridge, a cute pour over coffee pot and trader joe beans with a grinder! Basically I’m sad I can’t just move and stay in forever. People always say, “oh I’ll be back” but this is serious, I can’t wait to book again! I have best friends who live in the city and I’d still pay to stay in this awesome space! Airbnb MVP! Don’t hesitate! Book it now!",1.0

Chicago,"Great place! Great host! We actually had major delays on our flight out of Chicago and she offered for us to stay another night. We felt loved and cared for. If you want a spot not in the downtown hustle but still in the city enough to Uber for good rates, look no further. Quiet neighborhood. Pictures described the space very accurately. It was the perfect space for a quick getaway to Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"Amazing and beautiful first airbnb experience. The place was decorated very modern and was clean. Both the walk in shower and claw-foot tub were great and the water got very hot. The bed was super comfy! There were plenty of towels, extra sheets, and blankets to use as well. There were also nice personal touches such as food recommendations and stocked beverages in the fridge (water filter, coffee, and some wine). Me and my boyfriend had an amazing time.",1.0
Chicago,"Wonderful place to stay while visiting the windy city of Chicago! Not far from great restaurant, bars, shopping and downtown. The coach house is decorated to perfection in mid-century modern decor and very clean. My husband and I used Uber all weekend and waiting no longer than 2 min. for a pickup at the house.  Highly recommend a stay at this location.",1.0
Chicago,"Great place to stay in Chicago. The space is very functionable and artsy, open and airy- we loved it. Comfy bed, all amenities you would want and then far more are provided. There are even beautiful post cards for you to write home with! Highly recommend it!",1.0
Chicago,Ellie’s place is exactly what you see in the all - no false advertising. It’s very light and open and she maximizes the space greatly. She’s very easy to communicate with. The Damen & Western L stations are close enough walk which we utilized a lot. Would definitely stay here again!,1.0
Chicago,"Gorgeous! I loved staying here. It was in a cool neighborhood and the studio was clean, styled well, and the bathroom was top notch. I want to stay here every time I come back to Chicago. They also have postcards and stamps for your use. Sweet little detail. Thanks so much!",1.0

Chicago,"This is a gem of a space that is a close walk to some great cafes, shopping, and night life. As someone who travels a fair amount, I would say this was one of my favorite stays at an AirBNB. The space itself is very thoughtfully curated. ",1.0
Chicago,"There is a reason so many reviews start with how stylish the place is. That reason is because it is stunning and just as advertised! The level of detail and thought put in to the design is unbelievable.   Location is great, quick walk to the blue line. Check in/out is super easy, and the studio manual made our interactions minimal.   Great place to stay, will absolutely repeat.   Thanks again!",1.0
Chicago,"This place was great. It's worth the price just to swim around in that huge bathtub. Ellie was a great host, and the apartment had everything you could need for a great time in Chicago. I found most places I needed to go (food, cute shops, metro) to be about a ~10 min walk away, which I don't mind because I love to walk, but if you don't consider getting a car. It was really easy to get to downtown using the train. I have no complaints, this was an awesome  place!",1.0
Chicago,"This is such a cute, clean and comfortable space! I could stay here for weeks! Nice little neighborhood. Had initially worried about noise at night, but it did quiet down for a restful evening.  The fresh ground coffee, sodas, beer help to make it comfortable. Nice distance from downtown. Safe to run in the mornings with a park nearby. Love this place!",1.0
Chicago,"Ellie’s studio is absolutely stunning! She goes above & beyond for her guest! There are loads of local nicknacks laying around the studio to indulge into. She has her cabinets stocked with things one might need (ibuprofen, cotton swabs, razors, etc). The neighbor hood is very nice. There are not many of taxi’s in the area, so if you don’t drive one might want to download uber. Definitely worth the stay! Would definitely come back!",1.0
Chicago,"Fantastic stay! The studio was as pristine as pictured. You felt more like you were staying in a hotel than someone's home. Great amenities like shampoo, soft towels and even yoga mats! Would highly recommend,",1.0
Chicago,"Elinor's studio was a magical place, and I could tell as I soon as I stepped up to the door, because care was taken in styling the exterior with little faerie lights that sparkled. I hate to say this, but I can be a bit of snob when it comes aesthetic and decor. I have not one complaint about this studio. I was absolutely blown away. The incredible level of detail and design, even down to the studio's handbook was meticulous and thought out.  What's even more wonderful is the central location to all the haunts in the Bucktown/Wicker Park area. I drove and literally everywhere I went was less than a 10 minutes away. I can't imagine that taking public transportation would take any longer. If you do drive, Elinor provides a parking permit, which gives you the freedom to park anywhere in the vivinity without the fear of getting a ticket.  By far Elinor's place is one of the best spots I've stayed in for Air BnB. If you're looking for something magical and romantic (oh, I forgot to mention there's wonderfully restored claw-foot Victorian bath tub) look no further.",1.0
Chicago,Stayed here while visiting Chicago. The apartment was really clean and cozy and located in a really good location for our trip. We were able to park right out front for our stay and walk everywhere. If you're looking to spend time in the Ukrainian Village i would recommend staying here. Close to the train if ya want to travel other places too.,1.0
Chicago,"The initial observation of the space was of course a stylish space for a reasonable price.  Seeing the space in person is such an enjoyable experience - especially when noticing all the fine details not revealed in the online pics.  It is in those details that raises the level of impression and sets it apart from other spaces.    Elinor and I had minimal contact, but that was because instructions were clear on the check-in and check-out procedures, where to park, and even how to make the coffee - which we were thoroughly confused at first.    I enjoy exploring different places to stay when visiting areas, but I would consider staying here again on my next trip to Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"I enjoyed my stay at Elinor's studio apartment in Wicker Park.  The location was pefect for me.  The studio was quite stylish and had many personal touches, including a studio manual which I found quite helpful and fun.  I really appreciated the 2 bottles of wine and the beer selection in the fridge.  The kitchen was minimal but that was fine with me because I planned to enjoy Chicago's dining scene.  The bed was  very confortable, which was a definite plus.  The heater was somewhat louder than I was expecting, but that is the only concern I had.  I would definitely stay here again.",1.0
Chicago,"This is a great spot. Located near hip Wicker Park and related. Quiet, good access to Metro and very pleasant spot to hang out and do some work too. Hostess was very helpful on restaurants etc . This is a top BnB!!!",1.0
Chicago,"The space is exactly as described. Gorgeous. The bathroom is stylish, clean, and the shower is great. Would love to have a space like that in my own home tbh. They have cute touches throughout the studio, including Where Chefs Eat (I have that at home too!) and Studs Terkel's ""Working"" in the bathroom. The bed was really comfortable and once we figured out how to configure the NEST properly for our purposes, the temperature control was on point. One minor note is that both heat and cool air come out predominantly at the head of the bed, and it could be bothersome to people who are sensitive to dry air. My wife had to turn to the foot of the bed one night because she's super sensitive, but it didn't bother me much. The location was good for me because I don't need to be right downtown and don't mind taking a Lyft everywhere, plus I like to be in ""real"" neighborhoods. Puerto Rican restaurants abound as well as cool street art, if you care to venture around. It's about a twenty minute drive to many downtown area attractions. The hosts were very accommodating to my needs, as I had to cancel one day due to a family emergency. They were very easy to work with throughout. Will definitely look to return here my next stay in Chicago",1.0
Chicago,Elinor's place is close to perfect. Every corner of the space is thoughtfully detailed and styled. It's located very centrally to Logan Square and the Bucktown/Wicker Park area and I enjoyed walking the neighborhood in my downtime. Her communication was clear and extremely quick and I truly cannot say enough about how pleasant my stay was. Highly recommended.,1.0
Chicago,"Before I arrived, I loved the photos and thought the place would be perfect for my stay over New Year's. Walking in, it was somehow even better. From the furniture to the lighting to the tableware, everything in the space is very intentionally curated. I have a feeling the owners are designers; the whole place has a great aesthetic while still being comfortable. One of my favorite places I've stayed so far",1.0
Chicago,"We had a great stay at this charming, stylish studio. Clean digs and thoughtful touches like coffee, beer, and wine were lovely.

Chicago,"Beautiful decor with so much space! Instructions for checkin were easy to follow. The coffee and extras were great!  Very comfortable bed! The apartment has an urban ambiance. Jeremy provided parking passes and we were able to find parking a block away. Communication was excellent. Jeremy answered any questions I had almost immediately. Neighborhood had a safe feel. We walked to local restaurants close by. One unfortunate thing, which was no fault of our host- when we went to leave, we discoveredthat our catalytic converter was stolen off of our car. I had driven our older SUV since I knew it would be parked for several days. Turns out, these are easiervehicles to get under and cut. I would not hesitate to stay here again.",1.0

The entire unit was much more spacious than it appeared in the photos which was a welcomed surprise as I have stayed in several Airbnb's that were smaller than photographed.   You could not ask for a better location, one block from the blue line which made traveling to/from O'Hare and into downtown a breeze. You're also within walking distance to countless top notch restaurants and shops.  Jeremy was a very responsive and accommodating host and he really made us feel taken care of when we had some flight plan changes. I would recommend this apartment to anyone wanting to visit Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"There is much to like about this apartment.  It's spacious, has full amenities, plenty of character, parking is included, and the place is clean.  Wicker Park is growing, has a unique vibe, feels safe, and offers options within walking distance for groceries.  The area also has many choices for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and drinks.  We chose to use the kitchen for breakfast, and the waffle maker was a great perk.  A critical factor in comfort, rest and relaxation is the bed.  While clean, we found the mattress to be uncomfortable.  It currently presents itself as firm and lumpy with indentations and sag from years of use.  Upgrading this one very important item would make this location, apartment, and experience worth renting again.  We enjoyed our stay overall and will keep this as an option in the future.",1.0
Chicago,"Came to Chicago for my cousin's birthday party. It was in my old neighborhood, so I felt very much at home. The place was spacious and exactly how it was described! I briefly meet Jeremy when I arrived, he was extremely nice. Would love to come back here when I visit Chicago again.",1.0
Chicago,"I loved this loft and everything about it.  The location was great - 1.5 blocks from the CTA - we were able to explore the entire city using public transportation.  Check in and check out were a breeze.  Jeremy was kind and offered great suggestions when we met briefly during the stay.  The apartment was spotlessly clean, comfortable, quiet and well appointed.  This was my first visit to Chicago and I would gladly stay here on my next trip.",1.0
Chicago,"We loved this place. It's spacious and very convenient. If you have small children, you may want to know that there is a firehouse nearby, but it did not bother us, we expected city noises. There's a Metro station barely a block away. It's great to have a washer and dryer right in the apartment since we tend to pack very lightly. We greatly appreciated the neighborhood parking stickers Jeremey provided and we easily found parking about 1 block away on a safe, residential street. We'll stay here again next time we're in town.",1.0
Chicago,"This is a large, 1 bedroom apartment within 2 blocks of the blue line. Very convenient! There’s a well equipped full kitchen with a small grocery across the street. Of course there a numerous great restaurants in the area so there’s no need to cook. The apartment was very comfortable and clean. We had plenty of pillows, blankets, towels etc. which was much appreciated.",1.0
Chicago,"This was my very first AirBnB and if all of them are like this one, I'll never stay in a hotel again. Jeremey's communication was excellent from start to finish and his home is so beautiful and immaculate. It is easy to find and right off the blue line. The home had EVERYTHING I needed and then some. He even left me 2 day parking passes for the area which made people coming by easy to park nearby. It is in a very cool neighborhood and as a single woman staying in an area I've never been, I felt very safe. When I visit again, I would definitely stay there again.",1.0
Chicago,Jeremey is a wonderful host and his place is extremely nice. He is quick to respond with any questions and is willing to give recommendations around the city. The place was clean and decorated with care. It has everything you would need during your stay.,1.0
Chicago,"Jeremy's apartment is exactly as advertised - stylish, large, comfortable and spotlessly clean in a very safe, hip neighborhood.  The kitchen has all you would need to fix your own meals.  We, however, opted to take advantage of the multitude of excellent bars, coffee shops and restaurants within very easy walking distance on Division Street and North Milwaukee Avenue (for lovers of high quality Nepalese / Indian food we recommend Cumin on North Milwaukee). Communication with Jeremy was very easy.  If and when we return to this part of Chicago Wicker we would, without hesitation choose to stay in Jeremy's place.",1.0
Chicago,"We were very pleased with the apartment. With an updated modern kitchen and bathroom we had everything we needed to be comfortable. Jeremy was a great host, communicated all details we needed when needed.",1.0
Chicago,Jeremy's place was fantastic! It is really big. Was great to unpack and have space and feel at home. Really close to the blue line. Easy to get anywhere. Felt safe in the neighborhood. Fire station next door but never bothered us or woke us up. Would definitely stay again!,1.0
Chicago,Our stay was great! Jeremey was very responsive when we asked him about accommodating our two dogs during the stay. There was even a small crate provided that we ended up using for the smaller pup. Everything was just as described and the apartment is close to many great restaurants and shops. We'd stay again! :),1.0
Chicago,"Jeremey's place is fantastic -- it's bigger than we were expecting and has a really nice overall feel to it.  It's nicely decorated and has all the amenities you would need.  Jeremey was very quick to respond to messages and helped out if anything at all was needed.  Check-in was simple and the building felt secure.  It's just a couple minutes' walk to the blue line, which brings you right into downtown in about 10 minutes.  Also close to some cool spots on N Milwaukee, like Oiistar, the amazing ramen place.  Super nice experience and we'd definitely stay with Jeremey again!",1.0
Chicago,"This was perfect for our needs.  Everything was as advertised.  It's a beautiful space and the location is great.  (Ashland itself is not too appealing but you're a one-minute walk from blue line, can stroll west on Division or walk up Milwaukee Ave to Bucktown.).  Self-checkin was super easy and we had everything we needed.",1.0
Chicago,"Jeremy was very responsive, answering all questions quickly and thoroughly.  His place was nice and very clean.  My parents stayed at the Air BnB to visit me and were quite pleased.  Being that I own and live in downtown Chicago, I can say that this location fantastic and the price to be a great value.",1.0
Chicago,This place is one of the nicest accommodations I have ever stayed at. Yes the price is expensive compared to a hotel but if you want a solid night's sleep and little slice of home be sure to check out Jeremy's place!,1.0
Chicago,Wonderful place.  We really enjoyed ourselves and relaxed at Jeremey's loft.  Very clean.  We enjoyed being able to watch people on the streets from the loft.  Love the mixture of cultures which we don't get much of back home.  Location was great.  Very quick walk to get to Wicker Park and many great local restaurants as well.  Felt very safe in the neighborhood and at Jeremey's place.  Super nice people.  Jeremey is fantastic at returning messages.  Always a quick reply and we had no problems at all that couldn't be fixed quickly.  Highly recommend Jeremey's loft!,1.0
Chicago,"Jeremey's apartment far exceeded our expectations.  The pictures don't do justice to how beautiful, stylish and very spacious this place is, not to mention comfortable and clean.  Everything was simply perfect.  Every possible amenity to make you feel right at home--we wanted for nothing.  Comfortable bed and couches, beautiful, roomy bathroom with large shower and plenty of hot water, fully stocked kitchen, excellent wi-fi and incredibly easy check-in process. We loved the location, merely 2 short blocks (roughly 3 min) walk to the Blue line on the L/ subway.  So easy to get to the main attractions downtown, but also in a great spot to explore the Wicker Park/ West Town neighborhoods and all the great restaurants and shops.  An excellent Airbnb experience--Thank you, Jeremey!!",1.0
Chicago,We found it exactly as advertised—perhaps even better. Super accommodations in a great location. Jeremey was very accessible and promptly responded to our requests and questions. We look forward to staying there again on our next trip to Chicago.,1.0
Chicago,We LOVED the location. The area seemed very safe and was central to the blue line and a Divvy bike station. (Tip: take the blue line to and from O’hare to save a lot of money on transportation) The apartment was very roomy and we enjoyed having access to a kitchen. Something to note is the TV does not have cable or “smart” access. We ended up buying a firestick so we had something to watch while winding down at the end of our days. Jeremy was quick to respond any time we had questions or needed anything! Thank you for a great stay!,1.0
Chicago,"Better than it looked online, a beautiful space with everything needed and then some. Great location, close to public transportation and wonderful local spots. Jeremy was attentive and helpful with all of my queries. Would stay here whenever I’m in Chicago. Can’t recom enough!",1.0
Chicago,"This is a beautiful unit in a great neighborhood in Chicago.  Jeremy was a great host and was easy to communicate with.  Check-in and check-out were a breeze and the apartment was spotless.  It's on a busy street but there was very little noise.  The blue line is a block away as are Target, CVS and a bunch of great coffee shops and places to eat.  Also super easy to pick up a cab or an Uber/Lyft.  Would recommend this place without hesitation!",1.0
Chicago,Communication was fast and easy and Jeremey was available every step of the way.    Apartment was better than I expected.  Great location and very close to the Blue Line which can get you just about anywhere.     Would absolutely recommend and would stay here again in the future.   ,1.0
Chicago,"This is a spacious apartment and very nicely furnished. The location is just a few minutes walk from the blue line with quick transportation direct to the heart of downtown. Check-in was easy and the host provided a sheet with lots of helpful suggestions for local eating places, of which there are many.  Staying at Jeremey's place for 4 nights provided a very comfortable place to stay for our tired bodies after spending our days exploring Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,Jeremey’s place is very spacious and clean.  It has everything you need for a short or long term stay.  Jeremey is very nice and answers any question very promptly.  The location is also very convenient for travel on public transport.  Highly recommended!,1.0
Chicago,"Couldn't have asked for a better place. It was super easy to get to and from both town and O'Hare, with a Blue Line stop only one block away. It was beautiful and cheerful as well. Loved the full kitchen and nice extra-large tub. Jeremey was a lovely host. I wish we could have stayed even longer!",1.0
Chicago,"Great location with convenient transportation. The neighborhood has a cool vibe. As a vinyl record collector, I was excited about being across the street from Dusty Groove and close to Reckless Records. Great overall experience.",1.0
Chicago,"My wife and I spent 2 nights at Jeremey's place. While pictures can often be deceiving, we were pleasantly surprised at how large and open the apartment was in person. It was perfect. Jeremey was traveling in Spain at the time, but he was quick to respond to questions we had the day of and during the trip about things such as checking in and adjusting the nest thermostat. We'd happily stay there again.",1.0
Chicago,Great space in a convenient location—a vibrant neighborhood and just a block from blue line. The apartment has a good vibe and personality and is very clean. Jeremy was attentive and responsive. I’ll go back.,1.0
Chicago,"Jeremey's apartment is really great. It's large and bright in all the right places (and quieter and darker in the bedroom, which is lovely for sleeping), stylishly decorated (without being overdone--the decor fits the urban space perfectly), has a fantastic shower, everything you need for a comfortable stay and is in one of my favorite Chicago neighborhoods, with a bajiggety restaurants, bars, shops, etc. The provided parking passes are super helpful, especially for weekend stays, because parking in this part of the city is no joke (in fact, if you can manage without a car, do, because you won't need it once you're here--everything is walkable, lyft/uber is plentiful and the El train is literally right there.)  If mobility is an issue for you, you should know that you have to walk up a flight of steep, narrow stairs to get to the apartment. Also, it's really in the real city, and real cities generally aren't that quiet, so if you're a super sensitive sleeper who needs deep, dark silence, you'll maybe want to bring ear plugs and/or a sleep mask.   But otherwise, I completely recommend this place. Jeremey is a kind, helpful and responsive host, the apartment is so lovely, and it's a really great value for Chicago, too.",1.0
Chicago,"We enjoyed our stay at Jeremy’s place. It's conveniently located, about 15 minutes to the loop and 20 minutes to Midway airport. Although we got around with Uber, the blue line is just minutes across the street. The apartment is super clean and lovely decorated. Jeremy is very thoughtful with the travel guide and tips. It was great to meet a Cal alumni at Chicago. =) I would recommend this listing to everyone.",1.0
Chicago,"This home was great. Jeremey provided easy check in details and instructions. The location was great because I was close to everything downtown and many shops and stores. I recommend this home and would certainly stay here again. Thanks again, Jeremey!",1.0
Chicago,"Jeremy was easily accessible for any questions via text and he even checked in the second day to make sure everything was okay. The apartment spacious, comfortable and centrally located. Just a few steps to the blue line CTA train, restaurants and shops. The neighborhood is busy so the provided parking permits were a huge plus.",1.0
Chicago,"This space is amazing. Plenty of room, furnishings are great, kitchen has everything you could need, and the shower was perfect after a long day of exploring Chicago in the cold. Jeremey was prompt with responses and great about giving me tips on places to check out. Literally just a few steps away from the Blue Line which made getting around the city super easy. I will definitely be looking to get this place again next time I am in Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"Great place! We stayed there with our 18month during our summer holiday trip, all three of us loved Jeremey’s place. Bigger than expected. Jeremey was very supportive and fast with all kind of questions. We can highly recommend this place, also when you are traveling with small children.",1.0
Chicago,"What a great stay in Chicago!!! Jeremey‘s loft is perfectly situated in one of our favourite areas within Chicago. There are so many things to explore in walking distance: restaurants, shopping, parks, and the great 606 trail. The train („L“, blue line) - which is more or less directly in front of the apartment - connects you directly with downtown as well as with the airport. The apartment is so cool, we would love to live there! Despite the busy street in front of the house the apartments inside is so quiet and we slept like babies. Jeremey is a fantastic host and helped us a lot to find our ways, gave us great recommendations and answered immediately whenever we wrote a message. We will definitely come again!!!",1.0
Chicago,"A very spacious and spotlessly clean apartment, it holds special charm with bare brick walls and wooden floors with plenty of seating and a very large bed with a well equipped dressing room.  The bathroom is great with a very impressive bath for easing away the muscles after a long day of exploring.  We didn’t use the kitchen much apart from making a hot drink as we ate out most of the time but there is a great health food shop just opposite and a food shop just by the subway station.  Although we didn’t get to meet Jeremey his communication with us was superb.",1.0
Chicago,"Jeremy’s place is amazing, not only is it huge, it has everything you need for a comfortable stay, it’s in a great location for getting around town (literally one minute walk from the blue line at Division), and really easy to get to on the blue line from O’hare airport.  Jeremy was a fantastic host, very quick to respond to any queries we had, and was kind enough to let us leave our bags for a couple of hours while we went for brunch before heading back to the airport.  I would highly recommend his apartment to anyone wanting to explore Chicago.",1.0

Chicago,"Jeremey’s place is so beautiful, a perfect loft you could imagine with a view to a quiet street. It has lots of light, in the morning or in the evening too. Subway is 1 minute walking distance (literally)! Fire station in the adjacent building is not bothering at all, they turned out to be the most quiet neighbors we ever had :) Many thanks to Jeremey, we would like to return!",1.0
Chicago,Beautiful apartment thats is decorated to perfection. Its conveniently located (10 min walk to wicker park and 20 min subway to downtown). Jeremy was very accommodating and his local coffee & donut tips were great!,1.0
Chicago,"Rob’s place was beautiful! It looked exactly as advertised. The apartment was spacious & stylishly decorated. Lots of restaurants & bars within walking distance, as well as a grocery store. Rob was super responsive & hospitable. We were not able to check in before 3, but he allowed us to leave our luggage in his store prior to check in & even took it upstairs to the apartment for us! The only downside was that the bedroom can get a little warm, especially on a hot summer day. Other than that, we fully enjoyed our stay. Would definitely stay here again!",1.0
Chicago,"Rob’s Place was beautifully furnished and decorated. It was also only a 3 minute walk from the nearest bus stop which can take you to downtown or any of the metro/L lines - very convenient. The only downside is that there is no air conditioning in the bedroom so it got really hot. It is also on the 3rd floor so that’s something to consider if you don’t like taking the stairs. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and would recommend it!",1.0
Chicago,Rob's place is immaculate! I have never seen an Airbnb so tastefully decorated and cozy. Its in the middle of a bustling restaurant and shopping district but is surprisingly quiet. Rob himself was very responsive and a great host. I would definitely come back here for sure. Make sure you take advantage of the $20/day parking that Rob offers. It was a lifesaver.,1.0
Chicago,"My experience could not have been better. This was the mog immaculate, stylish, modern, and comfortable AirBnB experience I've ever had. The owner has spared no expense, from stainless steel alliances to remodeled bathrooms and showers, to new wood flooring. The temper-pedic bed was heavenly, and the furnishings were modern and comfortable. The attention to detail was unparalleled, from train maps and restaurant guides to Chicago artwork and plenty of cooking utensils and supplies, as well as beauty and hygiene products. I was beyond impressed with the level of care and consideration.   When I return to Chicago in the future, this will be my first choice. Always.",1.0
Chicago,We were In Chicago to see Hamilton and sightsee with our teenaged daughter. We loved this location and neighborhood. It felt safe and there were tons of nearby places to eat or get groceries. The condo itself was extremely clean and was well stocked with necessities. It was spacious and we never felt crowded. Rob was a great host and was very responsive to our questions. It was a plus to have  parking available as we never moved our car until we left Chicago. I would definitely rent from Rob again,1.0
Chicago,"Rob's place is incredibly stylish, supremely located, and overall provides a comfortable, beautiful perch from which to explore the city of Chicago.  As a host, Rob was incredibly hospitable and communicative, and was very helpful in getting me situated for the stay.  I highly recommend the apartment and would definitely stay here again!",1.0
Chicago,"This place is a fantastic stay!  Everything is wonderfully decorated, well thought-out, very clean, and it has an authenticity you can only find in a beautiful historic building.  The location is great as well. It’s a 13 minute drive to downtown Chicago, and 500 feet from the best breakfast place in town “Whisk”. You must go there!  Only thing missing in the Airbnb was coffee, so you may want to bring your own. But they have multiple ways to make it if you do.  Great stay, highly recommend this Airbnb!",1.0
Chicago,My wife and I came in to Chicago for our wedding anniversary and are so glad we chose to stay with Rob.  Probably the best Airbnb experience we’ve had.  He really thinks of everything and we can’t recommend staying here enough.,1.0

Chicago,"By far-this Rob's place is the most STUNNING home my husband and I stayed in. The décor is stylish, modern and pure class. The Holiday decorations made it festive and cozy. I really want those flocked trees!! LOL Absolutely gorgeous. The pictures of this listing does it NO JUSTICE!! Rob is a delight and one of thee most gracious hosts I have encountered. His level of hospitality is unparalleled and he gave us some great suggestions of local eateries in the area. His home is in great proximity to downtown and other neighborhoods. We truly could not be more pleased and dreaded leaving to return back to our home state. However, we will certainly be back and definitely in the process of making plans to book Rob's home again. You will not be disappointed!! Truly his home is a GEM!!!",1.0
Chicago,"The warmest home we've ever been in. Sparkling clean, modern and superb interior design, great location and a very lovely, warm host. Thank you, Rob and we promise to only stay at your place whenever we're in Chicago! An experience to remember!",1.0
Chicago,"This was the cleanest Airbnb we’ve ever stayed in. If you are picky with finding a clean place that actually FEELS clean, this home is for you. You can immediately tell that Rob takes pride in his apartment and everything is so well maintained and stylishly decorated. The bed was a welcomed place for rest after a long day, and we loved how firm the mattress was and how fluffy the pillows were—very comfortable.  The amenities were spot on, the coffeemaker, the gas stove, plenty of dishes and quality cookware to use for making a meal. Not mention, the exceptional decor of the entire apartment! The location was excellent and walkable to numerous local restaurants and bars (a few were literally steps from the apartment door). We loved being on the third floor and always felt super safe. There is some traffic noise that can be heard in the bedroom, but Rob provides earplugs for light sleepers. In truth, we actually enjoyed being lulled to sleep by the sounds of the city and it didn’t bother us at all. The convenience of the grocery store being a 5 minute walk away made buying some pantry and fridge essentials easy. The couch in the living room was super comfy and perfect for relaxing and watching the Thanksgiving Day parade and some Netflix Christmas movies. This was the perfect Airbnb and we were highly impressed (not always easy). 5 stars to Rob for such an amazingly clean, comfortable, stylish, and well thought out home away from home. We’ll be back soon!",1.0
Chicago,"This place is so much nicer in person! And wow the bed was so comfortable we ended up sleeping the first night we got there instead of going out because we got trapped in the bed lol. Communicating with Rob was very easy and his home was supplied with everything!! First aid kit, make up remover wipes you name it lol. The home is in a very quiet and safe neighborhood. Would definitely stay again, one of the nicest places I have ever stayed!",1.0
Chicago,"We had a short but wonderful stay at Rob's place for a weekend trip to Chicago. Communication and check-in were quick and easy, and it was a breeze to get there from the airport on the train and a bus.  The space was spotlessly clean and beautifully furnished, with thoughtful touches that made our stay really comfortable. The location is great too, with a grocery store nearby and lots of good food/drink options as well.  Our only regrets are that we didn't stay here longer to enjoy it more and that we had to catch a Sunday morning flight before we could peruse the beautiful store downstairs some more. We would definitely stay here again, and will happily recommend it to any family and friends who may be looking for a place to stay in Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"Rob’s apartment was exactly what we need for a wonderful stay in Chicago. It was styled beautifully and Rob provided everything we could possibly need- thought of everything!

Chicago,"This might be my favorite Airbnb stay to date. The apartment so stunning, clean, and comfortable and charming Ukrainian Village with so much to offer, we chose to make fewer trips into the heart of the city to spend more time enjoying and exploring the immediate surroundings both in and out of the apartment. Yoga, restaurants, shops, grocery...everything within walking distance and this little oasis to temporarily call home. Rob couldn’t have been a better host. Will be back for sure!",1.0
Chicago,Rob’s place was amazing. Right in the center of everything. The location was close to many restaurants and bars. It is also a short ride to surrounding neighborhoods and downtown. The place itself was amazing with all the amenities needed for a great stay. Rob was prompt in his communication and was right below if needed. The parking space was a bonus as it is hard to find parking in this neighborhood without a permit.,1.0
Chicago,"Location, atmosphere, beautiful decor, every thought to amenities (even a First Aid Kit!)... you simply can't go wrong with this great condo in Ukrainian Village.  It was a snowy weekend so we especially enjoyed the cabinet full of games!  We were visiting family in Streeterville and getting there was no problem at all.  Rob greeted us when I arrived, and check-out was very simple.  Also, my brother drove over from a neighboring city to meet me, so we appreciated the off-street parking for him and his daughter.  Stay with Rob!  You won't regret it.",1.0

Chicago,"This was our first AirBNB and I gave 5 stars all the way through. Chris was an amazing host. Quick responses and clear communication. Super helpful with us as we learned to navigate city, food and parking. Being from a rural area, we were grateful to have the help! Maps on fridge. Nice residential area, felt safe even at night. Extremely clean. Special touches such as video games and snacks. Went above and beyond to provide a welcoming and safe environment. Room was stylized, modern. Plenty of amenities, even access to laundry. If we make our way back to town, we’ll stay here again. Thank you for making our first AirBNB memorable!",1.0
Chicago,"Great place to stay! Very clean and convenient to food and shops! Reminded me of being Ina little apartment. The shower was a bit small, so if you're a larger person it may be difficult to fit. But it was a very nice place and the host were quick to respond.",1.0
Chicago,My husband and I love coming to Christopher’s place! Traveling to a larger city can be intimidating at times but Christopher is very knowledgeable about the area and has some general directions and maps ready for the guest. We will definitely be back to visit.,1.0
Chicago,"Christopher’s place was better than than described. He was also very accommodating and responsive. I’m not from here so the snow really changed some of our plans, but his home definitely made up for it. It was cozy and all the touches made us feel right at home. 11/10 would recommend!",1.0
Chicago,"Great stay, very clean and comfy bed. I liked that he had a full kitchen with lots of nice options to snack and drink in the fridge. Also nice to have a washer and dryer available to use. Would stay again.",1.0
Chicago,"We absolutely loved our say in Christopher's place. While it is a basement space, it has all the privacy you need including your own entrance. The decor is fantastic and we loved many of the little touches including the board games, tasteful art, game systems, and the water and drinks in the fridge were a welcome surprise after our evening arrival. Having central heat as well as a space heater in the unit helped make sure we stayed nice and toasty during our visit. We didn't take advantage of them, but the fact that a washer and dryer were available was a nice bonus.   We'll definitely look here first on our next trip to Chicago!",1.0
Chicago,"Chris responded promptly and accommodated a last minute early check in for me. The space was clean and even though it was a basement, the space heater kept the space warm. The living area also comes with roku, PlayStation and Nintendo. A great bargain.",1.0

He has snacks and beverages in the fridge. there is also a full kitchen for those wishing to stay long term.,1.0
Chicago,"What a gem! Christopher’s place was exactly as described including a ton of extras. Christopher was quick to respond before and during my stay. He left a light on for me the night I arrived since I had a super late flight. He even checked in on me the next day to make sure I had everything I needed. The place was totally spotless. The bed was very comfy and there were tons of extra pillows. The kitchen was fully equipped and he even stocked it with several quick food items. These were much appreciated especially the first morning. The space felt so much more roomy than I was expecting. Ceilings are a bit lower being a garden unit but I had no problem at all with it. The water pressure in the shower was really great. Christopher made a really detailed welcome guide with lots of great info abt the neighborhood. The studio is only 3 short blocks away from a bus that takes you directly to the belmont el station (abt a 20-30 min ride). I felt very safe in the neighborhood (family vibe) even when coming in using transit late at night by myself. If you are wanting to do a lot of things in the Loop, transit took me 45-hour sometimes depending on the time of day. This was not a big deal for me bc I wanted a neighborhood experience vs more of a downtown touristy one, but it did take longer to get to and from. Lastly, Christopher was kind enough to  hold my luggage for me on my last day since I had a later flight. All in all, fantastic experience and I highly recommend this listing. Thank you so much, Christopher!",1.0
Chicago,Christopher’s place was was everything I could have hoped for. It was a nice cozy place where my girlfriend and I felt immediately at home. Everything was spotless and even had fruits and sparkling water. Christopher is an amazing host and I would definitely stay there again and recommend to anyone! Thanks again for everything Christopher,1.0
Chicago,This is such a great place to stay! Awesome location between the airport and downtown. Uber’s were always there within 5 minutes and were reasonably priced for a ride to anywhere in the city. We really appreciated the snacks and food prep materials that were there and having the ability to make our own food when away from home. Chris was very responsive and was flexible with check in/check out times in relation to our flights. The accommodations were more than we were expecting! Highly recommend!,1.0

Chicago,"I very much enjoyed Chris and Paul's home. The decor was nice, they had local food suggestions, snacks and drinks, and plenty of towels. Chris was always quick to respond and very helpful.

I would definitely recommend this air bnb.",1.0
Chicago,"Christhopher's and Paul's place are great Host my girlfriend and I could not ask for more. We were delighted by the apples and other goodies the host provide for their guest. The studio is everything and much more a comfortable place can be it was clean, welcoming, and it is located in a safe neighborhood. Transportation was nearby and made our rides to the city very convinient, also we got to explore more of it by using transportation. Chris and Paul were very effective communicators they responded within a few minutes of us sending a message. We will definetely book again  when we go back to visit our family in the Chicago area. Thanks again Chris and Paul!!!",1.0
Chicago,"We found this to be a much better alternative to expensive hotels. This apartment was private, quiet, and clean. Parking on the street was easy. Chris was very helpful and communicative. The water in the fridge was appreciated! We only stayed one night, but this place has everything you'd need for an extended stay. ",1.0
Chicago,Chris was an amazing host.  His place was very clean and better than we expected.  This was the wife’s first time visiting Chicago and she wasn’t disappointed as this place offers a lot of space for two guests.  Parking on the same street was hit and miss but that can be expected for a big city.  We took Lyft anytime we were visiting downtown Chicago.  It was nice to come and go as we pleased.  Chris responded very quickly to any messages that were sent.  I felt safe enough walking in the general neighborhood.  When we visit Chicago again this would definitely be the first choice.  Our first host cancelled which brought us to finding this gem.,1.0
Chicago,Could not have asked for a better space and location.  Outstanding customer service and friendliness from Chris.  Plus the money we spent even with Uber was less than half the cost of a hotel.  If I could give more than 5 stars I would.,1.0
Chicago,"Chris was a great host.  Nice touches like beverages and snacks in the fridge, full compliment of toiletries, etc.  Bed was firm and super comfortable for a convertible type sofa.  Not at all like a typical pull out bed.  I slept great.  Parking on the street was not a problem and the neighborhood felt super safe.  His place is a couple of miles from my daughter and definitely more convenient, comfortable, and affordable than any nearby hotel.",1.0
Chicago,"Christopher's place is great! It was very clean and comfortable. Check in was easy and Christopher was very easy to get in touch with.

Chicago,"Chris was very accommodating and went above and beyond. There were some basic foods in the fridge, fruit, eggs, soda, and pancake mix. He also held our bags for us on our last day and let us pick them up one the way out. Very nice guy and was always on top of things.",1.0
Chicago,"I can't give Christopher enough praise! This was absolutely perfect for our first trip to Chicago and the basement studio was just wonderful! Not only was it incredibly clean, stocked with snacks and home-y touches, but it was very comfortable and Christopher was an amazing host. He was very open to helping us with our bags when we were a little early to check in and he held them for us so we could go explore the city and enjoy our visit. He was great at communicating with us in a professional and timely manner, and his place was extremely clean and organized. We really made the right decision by staying here! We hope to come back to the area and we will be looking to stay here again! I would recommend to anyone coming to the area! ",1.0

Chicago,"Chris' place is really lovely! Plenty of space for 2 people, with lots of thoughtful touches like biscuits, bottled water, tea and coffee etc! The kitchen was well equipped to make meals, and Chris quickly provided a can opener when we asked to borrow one. The washer and dryer in the apartment were also very handy. Good location in a residential neighbourhood, about 10-15 min walk to the local Aldi and 10 mins to shops, including the currency exchange to get bus tickets. 5 mins walk from the bus stop that takes you to the blue line, which then takes you to O'hare airport or downtown. It takes around an hour to get to the Museum campus, and about 45 mins to attractions like the Skydeck and Hancock Tower. Chris recommended an architecture boat tour which was fab. Communication was always fast and helpful, would definitely recommend!",1.0

Chicago,"Samantha’s place is modern cute chic. Every piece of furniture is well thought out with aesthetic and function in mind. The steps to the loft bedroom: first, it’s very roomy up there and cozy. The steps itself could be problematic for people who are afraid of heights but for someone like me who is uncoordinated, it was surprisingly easy to navigate. Although, I didn’t need anything, Samantha made me feel like she was only an email/text/phone call away if I needed assistance or info. Also, there’s a small but very cute balcony where u can enjoy your morning coffee.",1.0

Chicago,"Samantha & Jonathan's loft was exactly as pictured, and located in a convenient location. I loved the apartment - I would love to live here myself! The stairs to the loft was quite steep as others describe, and I left my suitcase downstairs and only went upstairs to sleep. The bed was very comfortable. My friend whom I stayed with wanted an easy access to the bathroom during night, so she decided to use the air mattress downstairs, which we found in the closet (we moved furnitures around to make space). The walk to the California CTA station was 15-20 min for me, but since it was quite a cold week, I often opted for Uber. As we had packed plans in downtown, we did not get to explore much of the neighborhood nor get to ask for neighborhood tips that Samantha was happy to share, but I'd love to come back to this loft and explore more!",1.0
Chicago,"The loft is located in a great quiet spot that is walking distance from great restaurants and bars. It was a ~15 minute walk from both the Logan Square and California blue line stops, and extremely close to tons and tons of good restaurants and bars (check out Lula, Giant, and Longman & Eagle). Samantha was a great host and the place was spotless when we arrived, with tea and some nice snacks sitting on the table. Checking in and out was as easy and quick as it gets, and we appreciated Samantha periodically messaging us to check on our experience. We would stay here again in a heartbeat. Our only warning is that all the stairs in the building are extremely steep and narrow. We didn't have any problems, but you should be careful. Overall a 5/5 experience.",1.0
Chicago,"The space is exactly as pictured.  Simple, basic, perfect for one or two people.  The bed in the loft was comfortable and the HDTV had plenty of premium channels.  The neighborhood is quiet and we felt safe.  Parking on the street wasn't an issue for us, but it did seem to be full in the evening.  Major bus line is 3 blocks away that will take you straight to the northside Fullerton train stops and the Blue Line station that goes to the loop is about 8 blocks away.  The host is easily reached and communication was great.  Thanks!",1.0
Chicago,"I enjoyed my stay in this space! The studio itself was very clean and quiet during sleeping hours.

Chicago,"Samantha's place is absolutely marvelous! It's located in a nice residential area, with some fun bars and restaurants in the neighborhood.

The apartment itself is really, really nice. Clean, spacious and an extremely comfy bed. I would highly recommend it to anybody!",1.0

Chicago,"Lovely apartment in a great area of the city.  Local amenities were perfect (I'd recommend Tony's for any grocery requirement and Wyler Road for a chilled drink and a bit to eat!) and not too far from the ""L"" to the Loop where it's a 20 min ride in.   Hosts were great and very responsive to any request and requirement we had and helped out as much as possible.  The stairs up to the mezzanine are definitely steep but we expected this from the description so not a problem at all and the apartment is carefully thought out to give maximum usability of the space.  Overall a fantastic expperience of this amazing city.",1.0

Furthermore, she always responded very quickly to questions from us. We ran in to her husband Jonathan a couple of times who was also super friendly and gave us a ton of advice on what to do in the city.

We would definitely recommend this place for a great visit to this great city",1.0
Chicago,"Lovely loft studio, spotlessly clean and very well designed with everything we needed. Location is good with the metro about 15 mins walk away then 20 mins to downtown, and a Chicago bike scheme station 5mins away and an even quicker cycle to downtown. We also enjoyed the 606 trail, Chicago's answer to the Highline which is also close by.  So a great place and a great location.",1.0
Chicago,Beautiful apartment in quite neighborhood. The space is great it's location relative to public transit is awesome. Samantha was quick to respond to any questions. I will definitely be checking availability next time I'm back in Chicago.,1.0
Chicago,"We had a great stay at Logan Square. The appartment was spacious (more so than we expected) and very clean with thoughtful provisions provided.   Samantha and Jonathon provided us with a great list of nearby places do eat and drink (from fresh coffee to pizza) and were very helpful in communicating when we asked for help.   Logan Sqaure itself is a lovely leafy neighbourhood around half an hr from Downtown on the train. There's plenty of amenities a short walk from the appartment, as well as loads of great bars. A taxi into Downtown is quicker but more expensive.   The 'L' (elevated train) is a 15-20 min walk from the appt and then a further 15 min or so ride into downtown where there is plenty to do. A weekly ticket for the train is around $30 and gives you access to trains and buses. Very handy for getting around as the bus and L system is easy to use.  On a clear day, we would recommend hiring a bike and taking the Lake Shore route which runs alongside Lake Michigan. You get stunning views of the iconic skyscrapers from across the water.  Hancock Tower on a clear day is also a must see too, with great views for miles.  If the weather is cooler, then there are loads of great museums to visit. the History of Chicago by Lincoln Park is great. The Old Town is nearby for a drink afterwards too.  Definitely a great city to visit with lots to do, and a great appartment in a great neighbourhood. 10/10  Thanks",1.0
Chicago,"The apartment was lovely, clean, and the coffee/snacks were appreciated. The security within the apartment was great, and although the surrounding area was less confidence-inspiring, she had us send a photo of our car once we arrived, and the area had cameras, so it put me at ease. We were super close to both bus and train options that we utilized several times, and within walking distance of target for quick pick-ups. We enjoyed our stay!",1.0
Chicago,"Kay is the best superhost you will ever have!! She is great with communication and is very welcoming! Her apartment has a home-like feeling that will make your vacation even better. Cleanest place ever!! Absolutely spotless and smells amazing!!  If you are looking for suggestions of where to eat and shop, Kay will give you a list of her favorite places and provides a variety brochures, pamphlets, flyers, and food menu’s! I had mentioned my family was vegan and she gave me options of food choices around the area!  Great location!!! I highly recommend staying at Kay’s place if you are visiting Chicago!!",1.0
Chicago,"Kay’s place was very cute and clean!! She was super quick to respond to anything. The train is a quick walk from the apartment though I don’t think I would personally feel safe walking from the train tooo late at night as a young lady. Loved how she  had treats available like bananas, it’s, orange juice, coffee. It is very convenient for a quick trip to downtown Chicago!",1.0
Chicago,"Even though Kay's place was more on the south side of Chicago and I was going to the north side for a Cubs game, her place was great for a one-night stay with how reasonably priced it was right before Memorial Day weekend. I just got ubers to get to and from the game rather than public transit. Kay's place was very comfortable and she was a great host!",1.0
Chicago,"Kay’s place was amazing! Such thoughtful, kind touches, and Kay is super communicative. Seriously, this room was nicer and more well-equipped than some of the luxury hotel’s I’ve stayed at. 100% would stay here again!",1.0
Chicago,"From the extreme cleanliness of the apartment to the added extras everywhere you turn, this place was absolutely perfect! The host is respectful and generous with the most friendly senior kitty ever! Coming “home” to a snuggly feline in the living room was probably the best thing ever (I’m an extreme cat person). However, if you’re not into cats, no worries; the cat isn’t pushy and you could probably spend your entire trip ~not~ seeing him if that’s more your style. The off-street parking was clean and safe, something that can be hard to secure in Chicago. The apartment is located very close to both the train and the bus, making in-city traveling quite easy. I would highly recommend this AirBnB!",1.0
Chicago,It’s a wonderful and comfortable place to stay. Kay is really great at communicating with guests and is super nice and welcoming. The space is very clean and has a nice charm to it. We only stayed for one night but I definitely will keep this place in mind if I ever make it up to Chicago again.,1.0
Chicago,I extremely enjoyed my stay at Kay's place.  The location is perfect. My favorite part was having a Target with a Starbucks and market near by. This place is also closely located to a CTA and the freeway entrance if you have a car.  Kay provides many good ameneties and I was very happy for that. She is quickly responsive and super helpful. I'm glad I got to meet her. She is a sweet person.  It is 15 min away from the city.    Also if you have a rental/car there is parking near by!!!  Thanks Kay,1.0
Chicago,"Five stars isn’t enough! Kay made me feel very welcome and comfortable. I felt as if I was staying with family or an old friend, definitely not a stranger. She provided breakfast and coffee for me before I headed out and it definitely gave me a great start. I have a cat at my place, so their friendly lil guy made me feel even more at home. I would definitely recommend her to anyone else and will definitely stay with her again if the opportunity arises.",1.0
Chicago,"I was pleasantly surprised by how amazing the experience turned out to be at Kay's home. The entire house felt inviting and immediately puts you at ease. She puts the guest first and it shows in her thoughtful approach to outfitting the room. From soft bath towels and a loofah at your bedside, to the coffee and tea bar in the kitchen for hot drinks in the morning. She really wants you to feel like you are taken care of the moment you walk in the door. The location is convenient with good selection of restaurants in the area to choose from and downtown is a hop and a skip away for those who want to take in the sights. If it isn't obvious already,  I highly recommend staying with Kay during your trip to Chicago!",1.0
Chicago,"I stayed at Kay's place with two of my friends over St. Pat's weekend. The free parking was a huge blessing, and the apartment was very close to the CTA for local travel. The apartment itself was clean and well-kept. Kay was a wonderful host! From giving us travel recommendations to providing some St. Patrick's day accessories, she made our stay as enjoyable as possible. We also enjoyed helping ourselves to the coffee bar and playing with her adorable cat. All of our expectations for our stay were far exceeded and I would gladly stay here again.",1.0

Chicago,"Kay was a perfect host. She went out of her way to make sure I was comfortable and ensured I had everything I needed. Her place is so cute and even offers a breakfast bar with coffee, snacks and breakfast foods. She even left a loofa, towels and washcloths for me with chocolates. Also, there were loads of local brochures and magazines to browse. Her 16 year old cat Toby is such a love! He was super friendly and sweet. It was raining on the day I was going out to adventure in the city and I Kay was so cool about lending me her umbrella. She’s a kind soul and was so helpful with local tips for eats and getting around. Highly recommend staying at Kay’s!",1.0
Chicago,"Kay provided a great Airbnb! She was prompt in her responses and provided a few extra touches that made our stay very welcoming (water bottles in the room's mini-fridge, clear and prompt communication, breakfast items (although we skipped out on those), well-labeled instructions outside the door on how to get in as well as within the house to make things very clear, etc.)",1.0
Chicago,"Best Airbnb I've stayed in!

Kay was also super nice and accommodating. I would definitely stay here again and recommend to others!",1.0
Chicago,"Kay's place was perfect for me- free parking in a lot, close to the metro, and south (the direction I was coming from).  Kay is friendly, and her place is clean.  I'll definitely see if Kay's place is available the next time I  visit Chicago!",1.0
Chicago,Kay is an Amazing host with an air bnb that makes you feel at home! The entire house is sparkling clean and full of creative and cute decor. This room is spacious and fully furnished with all the amenities you may need. The check-in/out is simple with thorough instructions. The el (CTA train) is a short 5min walk in a safe neighborhood. This is the second time I’ve stayed here and both times there were other guests yet it was very quiet and comfortable stay and rest. Respect this space as it truly is a gem!,1.0
Chicago,Great stay. Kay’s place was in a great location close to downtown and public transportation. The room and bathroom were very clean and had nice touches. Didn’t meet Kay until the last night (my schedule) but she was very nice and personable. If definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone!! Thank you Kay,1.0

Chicago,"Kay's place was really awesome in a good neighborhood, easily accessible from public transport. Very highly recommended, especially for budget travelers like myself.   The apartment and room were cozy and I felt like being at home during my stay, with access to kitchen and living room area. The cat is super friendly too!   Kay as a person was a nice host. She even gave me some medicine upon request, as I was catching some cold from the weather in Chicago.   If I ever come back to Chicago I have a reliable place to stay :)",1.0
Chicago,"Kay is an absolute pro of a host.  She communicated check-in instructions very clearly and regularly  touched-base to make sure I had everything I needed during my stay.  Her place is ideally situated a mere 5 minute walk from an L train station (which is a fantastic way to get around Chicago as I discovered).  Very comfortable, clean, and safe place to spend your nights when visiting Chicago-- can't recommend enough.",1.0
Chicago,"The misfortune of staying at Kay's is that one will quickly realize that not every host will be like her! :-/ I was able to take the train (as she pre-stay suggested) directly out of midway and walk about 2 blocks & if cleanliness is next to godliness, then trust Kay has you covered. And to be completely honest, Kay extended herself to me in an act that goes way beyond the scope of AirBnb. I was comfortable, I felt safe, the room was very dedicated. Being that she was my 1st AirBnb experience,  I really feel like I lucked up. Omg, and her snack bar (fresh yummies), were too delish! :-* #BookHer",1.0
Chicago,"Kay is a fantastic host and I can not recommend her enough. When we contacted her for anything we needed, the response was lightning-fast! She was courteous and made her home warm and inviting for her guests. She really took a burden off our shoulders while planning a last-minute trip to Chicago. If you’re looking for a great experience for a really reasonable price, definitely book with Kay!",1.0
Chicago,"If I could give 6 stars I would. Kay's place was immaculate, cute, comfortable, easy to access — everything you could ask for in an Airbnb. Kay herself is an excellent and hospitable host, helping us out with umbrellas, breakfast, sunscreen, loofas — all the little things that shows she truly cares about making her guests' experience as amazing as possible. She is a gracious and generous person and I would 100% stay at her property again. ",1.0
Chicago,"If you don't like stairs or cats, that is the only reason not to stay here. Location is good, ample parking & light outdoors- ammenities are top & Kay is an awesome host with a BIG heart for her aging cat- that alone should make her 1st choice for any cat lover.",1.0
Chicago,Kay's place was absolutely amazing. She was a perfect host and made my vacation feel so comfortable. I was traveling alone and one late night she even messaged me to make sure I was ok. I think that was such an amazing gesture. The room and apartment was exactly as described and so comfortable. ,1.0

Stay at the Sprocket if you can!",1.0

Danielle gave us a mega list of recommendations ahead of time, which was super helpful and full of cool restaurants and bars. The apartment is in Logan Square, and while we spent a good deal of time there and in places like Wicker Park, the freezing weather had us in lots of Uber’s downtown as well — just something to keep in mind. Though, it’s also off a subway line. Overall, no complaints, and Danielle’s communication was amazing. Would definitely recommend.",1.0

Chicago,"This has got to be in the top two best airbnb experiences I've had. Danielle's place is so cozy and looks amazing. We ended up spending a lazy Sunday lounging inside by the fireplace and watching dumb movies - an ideal way to spend a day after heavy touristing Friday and Saturday. She was incredibly accommodating throughout our stay with complications our party had with check in and check out. The surrounding area had an incredible pizza place, a bar where we got boozy ice cream floats, some breweries, and way more that we didn't have time to discover because we didn't want to leave the fire. Will 100% look to stay here again in the future!",1.0

Chicago,This was a truly desperate search for a safe place for my daughter to stay last minute while out of town.  She made last minute plans to travel to Chicago for the Gold Cup soccer match.  Once there she could not find a hotel to rent to her because she is 18.  She was in her car crying.  I booked with Jim on the internet and spoke with him by phone.  He was so great!!!  He met her and her boyfriend at the door.  He even spoke Spanish with her boyfriend which made him feel great.  He assured me by phone about how safe the neighborhood  was and that he would be on the premises just a moments notice away.  He treated them like adults but still helped me feel comfortable about their safety knowing they will always be my babies.  It was truly above and beyond.  And my daughter said the apartment was gorgeous.,1.0

Nice quiet neighborhood with Uber/lyft convenience to most city locations in 15-20 min. Apartment is on ground floor, some street noise but overall very quiet. Neighborhood is safe with quick walks to great eating spots. We recommend the little red wolf & mhenry.  Apartment is well furnished with nice appliances & conveniences, great WiFi. Host was attentive, but only needed on day 1: we’re pretty low key. Only recommendation would be additional blankets/ linens for pull out couch in living area.",1.0

Chicago,"Our stay in Chicago was great and we really enjoyed staying in Andersonville. It was far enough away to be quiet but only a 12-15 minute walk to the train station, which we didn’t mind at all. The neighborhood felt safe enough to walk in and we liked the local coffee shops and restaurants.   The apartment was nicely decorated and clean. I would just give a heads up that if you’re a light sleeper you can hear the hosts upstairs because it’s an old building. I would never take away a star for this because it’s just a personal thing. My wife is a heavy sleeper and it never bothered her but I had to download a white noise app on my phone to fall asleep.   The hosts were great communicators and asked if we needed anything and how our stay was going. We both enjoyed it and would stay here again!",1.0

Chicago,"Jim's place was FANTASTIC. The place was exactly what we expected it to be from the fabulous photos which were 100% accurate showing off the truly lovely and well decorated apartment. Very clean, well appointed, extra towels and pillows, fantastic magazines for relaxing reading, GREAT map of the local neighborhood in order to find fantastic local shops and places to eat.  You can totally get around on public transit (mostly CTA Bus) from this apartment. Note: the place is a little far from the CTA train stations into downtown. We rented a car and really appreciated the flexibility to get around the city easily and great neighborhood street parking.   The apartment is well appointed with everything you need for your stay. One of the bedrooms is street facing but there is not much traffic so it stayed very quiet at night. Air conditioning for the summer time is a huge plus on muggy hot days!  Andersonville neighborhood is one of my favorite areas of Chicago. It is quaint, full of local  charm, great eats and drinks within walking distance, and a fantastic way to get a feel of what real Chicago is like (and not the fake touristy stuff). Off the beaten path geek thing we did - we drove to and walked through the nearby Rosehill Cemetery Mausoleum. The old original section has a substantial collection of LC Tiffany stained glass windows and walking the completely silent hallways to see the sun shining through these beautiful windows is pretty awesome if you like that sort of thing.  Love Jim's place! Beyond 5 stars! We will hopefully be back to town and rent out his apartment again in the future. ",1.0

Getting in was very convenient, there were snacks left there for us to enjoy, parking on the street was easy, and Jim and Maximo always responded immediately to all of our queries, plus checked in to see if we wanted coffee, or needed anything else from them, checked on the comfort of the beds, and generally made sure that we had a great stay and felt well cared for. The kitchen is well appointed - the only thing not available was a microwave, but Maximo commented that he's about to get one for the apartment so that can be expected soon.  This is a great apartment with caring and involved hosts. I recommend staying here unconditionally!",1.0
Chicago,"The apartment was beautiful and very spacious. There are restaurants, grocery stores and pharmacies within walking distance. The neighborhood seemed very safe and we enjoyed walking around even in the cold weather. The Keurig and snack basket were nice touches which we appreciated. The beds were  too firm to be comfortable for me, but my boyfriend was fine with it, so it may be personal preference. Jim and Maximo were very attentive and always ready to help. Please note, the apartment does not have a microwave. Also, there is a policy that you cannot have any guest enter into the apartment (not just for sleeping, but for visiting too) which I misunderstood when booking, but it was not a problem since it was only the two of us. If you're traveling in a group or with family staying in other places, you may want to look for another place if you want them to be able to visit you. Overall our stay was lovely and we would recommend this apartment.",1.0
Chicago,"Location, location, location! The spot is located in a beautiful historic neighbourhood filled with lots of charm, great shops, and fantastic restaurants within walking distance. The space was incredibly clean, beautifully decorated, and had everything we needed for a great weekend. Jim was a great host and provided all the amenities we could have needed. 10/10 would stay here again!",1.0
Chicago,"This is a clean and beautifull apartment. Really clean and tidy, felt like home.  Close to coffee shops and general shops.  Jim and Maximo  checked up on me to make sure all my needs were meet and told me where the good coffee shops are. I highly recommend staying. I will deff come back in the future. 10/10 :)",1.0
Chicago,"This was my second stay at Ellie’s place, and I maintain that it’s one of the best Airbnbs ever! So quiet, clean, stylish, and comfortable. The tub is awesome and the coffee’s great, what more could I ask for?",1.0
Chicago,"Place was great! Clean, cozy, great location. Check in & out went seamlessly. LOVED the bathtub and shower. I would definitely recommend. The TV package was a surprising plus.. not usually one to hang out too much at a bnb- but after a day of drinking at Wrigley we were feeling a little rough-  it was so nice to just chill out the next day watching movies and ordering food! Loved it!",1.0
Chicago,"As a single traveler the studio set up was perfect for me. The location was great, since I had just been staying downtown at a conference prior to my stay it was nice to get out a bit and see some other neighborhoods. I could easily walk to the 606 Trail - which I really enjoyed - and N Milwaukee Ave for some fun shopping. I appreciated the guide they had in the studio with local recommendations listed, I got take-out from the Indian place down the street and it was delicious. Very comfortable bed!",1.0
Chicago,"Elinor went above and beyond to accommodate our stay, the level of hospitality was excellent!   The space is gorgeous and welcoming. I love that every detail was thought out, and this carries out throughout all the pieces in the home. Definitely a gem in the city.",1.0
Chicago,"Loved my stay here! Very comfortable bed, very clean, artistic space, thoughtful books and postcards, easy check in and out. Highly recommend staying here if you want to be in the Wicker Park area of Chicago!",1.0
Chicago,"I absolutely loved this place! I already told my sister that when we get the chance to go to Chicago together we will absolutely have to stay there. It was the perfect size and had everything I needed. The style of the whole place was gorgeous. I can tell a lot of thought went into creating this space. The shower and bathtub were amazing, and it was very helpful that there was a hair dryer, shampoo/conditioner, body wash, etc. When I do get the chance to travel to Chicago again I hope this is available. I can’t say enough about how much I loved this place!",1.0
Chicago,"From the incredibly easy check in and location, to the thoughtful touches that made us feel at home, to the impeccably curated style, we absolutely loved stayed here. It will be our go to any time we are back in Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"What can I say except that Elinor’s place was great! The little touches, such as welcome beers, pour over coffee, books on Chicago, and available toilet trees (we flew in and only had carry-one) were perfect. We only used the room for sleeping since we spent most of our day and night exploring the city! The weather is Chicago sure is unpredictable and crazy, so make sure you have a jacket or umbrella on stand by! Haha Thank you again for allowing us to stay in your lovely place!",1.0
Chicago,"We loved this place! It has all of the amenities and comfort of a nice hotel and more. The space was stunning, just like the photos. It felt very private which was great. We appreciated all of the books about Chicago and local restaurants. We’ll be back!",1.0
Chicago,This place is exactly as it looks! Super cute with personal touches so you know you’re getting an authentic experience. It’s close enough to the L to make traveling to and from the city accessible! Would for sure stay here again; wish I had more time :),1.0
Chicago,"OMG this place is so fantastic. It's PERFECT. I'm going to stay here again for sure! Great location, excellent host, so stylish and cool. The place also comes with an amazing little booklet to tell you how to use the WiFi and coffeemaker, and how to get around.",1.0
Chicago,"If I had more a sense of self-interest, I would write the  worst review ever so that this amazing space is always available for me when I'm in Chicago. First: it is it's own little building in the city. Wow! It's designed so beautifully, I took tons of photos to inspire my guest house back in CT. Elinor was responsive, accommodating, and super nice. I'm spreading the word to all of my friends who are jazzed staying there. The location is 10-12 minutes from downtown... well worth it for these gorgeous accommodations. BTW: the photos don't really capture the details and inviting sweetness of the place. I'll see you again, Elinor!",1.0
Chicago,"Ellie and Devin's space is charming! It's a well-designed, well-maintained large studio with incredibly thoughtful touches: books about the history of Chicago, more books from Chicago based writers and poets, games, postcards, and even stamps. I was a little nervous the first night with the studio being so close to the street, but I slept like a dream – the bed is comfortable and the studio is airy and bright. The place is exactly as pictured, even better. Ellie and Devin were very responsive and helpful. I would definitely come back and highly recommend staying here.",1.0
Chicago,This place is in the best part of the city! So easy to walk everywhere! It is clean with amazing amenities! The cute little touches! The great bath and shower! The delicious pour-over coffee! I want to stay there again.,1.0
Chicago,Elinor’s apartment is the perfect place for a cozy and stylish stay in Chicago. Everything we could’ve needed was provided and Elinor’s neighborhood recommendations were superb! I would highly recommend this place to anyone wanting to visit Chicago (and to avoid tourist traps)!,1.0
Chicago,"I can’t say it enough- this is THE best Airbnb I’ve ever stayed at and is so cozy! It’s worth every penny! I came to take my boards and it was just perfect for the stay. It’s so stylish, quaint, adorable neighborhood, and the little touches are unlimited! There was wine and beer stocked in the fridge, a cute pour over coffee pot and trader joe beans with a grinder! Basically I’m sad I can’t just move and stay in forever. People always say, “oh I’ll be back” but this is serious, I can’t wait to book again! I have best friends who live in the city and I’d still pay to stay in this awesome space! Airbnb MVP! Don’t hesitate! Book it now!",1.0
Chicago,"What you see on the photos are absolutely accurate and more! Loved the open space, high ceilings and obviously the bath. I've been using Airbnb for most of my travels and this is one of the nicest and most aesthetically pleasing location I have ever stayed at!",1.0
Chicago,"My fiancé and I were in town to celebrate our anniversary weekend. We couldn't have picked a better place to stay. The open layout, soft lighting, and claw foot tub all made it seem like a dream. Thank you so much!",1.0
Chicago,"Ellie was fantastic, super fast responses to my emails. Her place was fantastic, and right in the neighborhood where we needed to be. Hate to say this, but she could easily get more per night given the location and how awesome the space is.   Cheers!",1.0
Chicago,"Great place! Great host! We actually had major delays on our flight out of Chicago and she offered for us to stay another night. We felt loved and cared for. If you want a spot not in the downtown hustle but still in the city enough to Uber for good rates, look no further. Quiet neighborhood. Pictures described the space very accurately. It was the perfect space for a quick getaway to Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"Amazing and beautiful first airbnb experience. The place was decorated very modern and was clean. Both the walk in shower and claw-foot tub were great and the water got very hot. The bed was super comfy! There were plenty of towels, extra sheets, and blankets to use as well. There were also nice personal touches such as food recommendations and stocked beverages in the fridge (water filter, coffee, and some wine). Me and my boyfriend had an amazing time.",1.0
Chicago,"Wonderful place to stay while visiting the windy city of Chicago! Not far from great restaurant, bars, shopping and downtown. The coach house is decorated to perfection in mid-century modern decor and very clean. My husband and I used Uber all weekend and waiting no longer than 2 min. for a pickup at the house.  Highly recommend a stay at this location.",1.0
Chicago,"Great place to stay in Chicago. The space is very functionable and artsy, open and airy- we loved it. Comfy bed, all amenities you would want and then far more are provided. There are even beautiful post cards for you to write home with! Highly recommend it!",1.0
Chicago,Ellie’s place is exactly what you see in the all - no false advertising. It’s very light and open and she maximizes the space greatly. She’s very easy to communicate with. The Damen & Western L stations are close enough walk which we utilized a lot. Would definitely stay here again!,1.0
Chicago,"Gorgeous! I loved staying here. It was in a cool neighborhood and the studio was clean, styled well, and the bathroom was top notch. I want to stay here every time I come back to Chicago. They also have postcards and stamps for your use. Sweet little detail. Thanks so much!",1.0
Chicago,"This is a fantastic place. Super bright, extremely clean, great design, and extremely comfortable. Parking was easy. Check in and check out were super convenient and Elinor was very responsive. Can’t recommend highly enough!",1.0
Chicago,Eleanor's place was fantastic! Every detail was thought of including the courtesy postcards depicting her cat who sits in the window in the house on Artesian Street on the front. I would come back to Chicago just to hang out in this cool Studio for a weekend.,1.0
Chicago,"This is a gem of a space that is a close walk to some great cafes, shopping, and night life. As someone who travels a fair amount, I would say this was one of my favorite stays at an AirBNB. The space itself is very thoughtfully curated. ",1.0
Chicago,"There is a reason so many reviews start with how stylish the place is. That reason is because it is stunning and just as advertised! The level of detail and thought put in to the design is unbelievable.   Location is great, quick walk to the blue line. Check in/out is super easy, and the studio manual made our interactions minimal.   Great place to stay, will absolutely repeat.   Thanks again!",1.0
Chicago,"This place was great. It's worth the price just to swim around in that huge bathtub. Ellie was a great host, and the apartment had everything you could need for a great time in Chicago. I found most places I needed to go (food, cute shops, metro) to be about a ~10 min walk away, which I don't mind because I love to walk, but if you don't consider getting a car. It was really easy to get to downtown using the train. I have no complaints, this was an awesome  place!",1.0
Chicago,"This is such a cute, clean and comfortable space! I could stay here for weeks! Nice little neighborhood. Had initially worried about noise at night, but it did quiet down for a restful evening.  The fresh ground coffee, sodas, beer help to make it comfortable. Nice distance from downtown. Safe to run in the mornings with a park nearby. Love this place!",1.0
Chicago,"Ellie’s studio is absolutely stunning! She goes above & beyond for her guest! There are loads of local nicknacks laying around the studio to indulge into. She has her cabinets stocked with things one might need (ibuprofen, cotton swabs, razors, etc). The neighbor hood is very nice. There are not many of taxi’s in the area, so if you don’t drive one might want to download uber. Definitely worth the stay! Would definitely come back!",1.0
Chicago,"Fantastic stay! The studio was as pristine as pictured. You felt more like you were staying in a hotel than someone's home. Great amenities like shampoo, soft towels and even yoga mats! Would highly recommend,",1.0
Chicago,"Elinor's studio was a magical place, and I could tell as I soon as I stepped up to the door, because care was taken in styling the exterior with little faerie lights that sparkled. I hate to say this, but I can be a bit of snob when it comes aesthetic and decor. I have not one complaint about this studio. I was absolutely blown away. The incredible level of detail and design, even down to the studio's handbook was meticulous and thought out.  What's even more wonderful is the central location to all the haunts in the Bucktown/Wicker Park area. I drove and literally everywhere I went was less than a 10 minutes away. I can't imagine that taking public transportation would take any longer. If you do drive, Elinor provides a parking permit, which gives you the freedom to park anywhere in the vivinity without the fear of getting a ticket.  By far Elinor's place is one of the best spots I've stayed in for Air BnB. If you're looking for something magical and romantic (oh, I forgot to mention there's wonderfully restored claw-foot Victorian bath tub) look no further.",1.0
Chicago,Stayed here while visiting Chicago. The apartment was really clean and cozy and located in a really good location for our trip. We were able to park right out front for our stay and walk everywhere. If you're looking to spend time in the Ukrainian Village i would recommend staying here. Close to the train if ya want to travel other places too.,1.0
Chicago,"The initial observation of the space was of course a stylish space for a reasonable price.  Seeing the space in person is such an enjoyable experience - especially when noticing all the fine details not revealed in the online pics.  It is in those details that raises the level of impression and sets it apart from other spaces.    Elinor and I had minimal contact, but that was because instructions were clear on the check-in and check-out procedures, where to park, and even how to make the coffee - which we were thoroughly confused at first.    I enjoy exploring different places to stay when visiting areas, but I would consider staying here again on my next trip to Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"I enjoyed my stay at Elinor's studio apartment in Wicker Park.  The location was pefect for me.  The studio was quite stylish and had many personal touches, including a studio manual which I found quite helpful and fun.  I really appreciated the 2 bottles of wine and the beer selection in the fridge.  The kitchen was minimal but that was fine with me because I planned to enjoy Chicago's dining scene.  The bed was  very confortable, which was a definite plus.  The heater was somewhat louder than I was expecting, but that is the only concern I had.  I would definitely stay here again.",1.0
Chicago,"This is a great spot. Located near hip Wicker Park and related. Quiet, good access to Metro and very pleasant spot to hang out and do some work too. Hostess was very helpful on restaurants etc . This is a top BnB!!!",1.0
Chicago,"The space is exactly as described. Gorgeous. The bathroom is stylish, clean, and the shower is great. Would love to have a space like that in my own home tbh. They have cute touches throughout the studio, including Where Chefs Eat (I have that at home too!) and Studs Terkel's ""Working"" in the bathroom. The bed was really comfortable and once we figured out how to configure the NEST properly for our purposes, the temperature control was on point. One minor note is that both heat and cool air come out predominantly at the head of the bed, and it could be bothersome to people who are sensitive to dry air. My wife had to turn to the foot of the bed one night because she's super sensitive, but it didn't bother me much. The location was good for me because I don't need to be right downtown and don't mind taking a Lyft everywhere, plus I like to be in ""real"" neighborhoods. Puerto Rican restaurants abound as well as cool street art, if you care to venture around. It's about a twenty minute drive to many downtown area attractions. The hosts were very accommodating to my needs, as I had to cancel one day due to a family emergency. They were very easy to work with throughout. Will definitely look to return here my next stay in Chicago",1.0
Chicago,Elinor's place is close to perfect. Every corner of the space is thoughtfully detailed and styled. It's located very centrally to Logan Square and the Bucktown/Wicker Park area and I enjoyed walking the neighborhood in my downtime. Her communication was clear and extremely quick and I truly cannot say enough about how pleasant my stay was. Highly recommended.,1.0
Chicago,"Before I arrived, I loved the photos and thought the place would be perfect for my stay over New Year's. Walking in, it was somehow even better. From the furniture to the lighting to the tableware, everything in the space is very intentionally curated. I have a feeling the owners are designers; the whole place has a great aesthetic while still being comfortable. One of my favorite places I've stayed so far",1.0
Chicago,"We had a great stay at this charming, stylish studio. Clean digs and thoughtful touches like coffee, beer, and wine were lovely. Location was perfect for getting around town by foot or Lyft, yet the street itself was quiet and residential. Great host communication and simple check in and check out. Would stay again in a heartbeat!",1.0
Chicago,"I love this spot . The layout, decor and vibe are definitely hip. Everything is so easy + the communication with Elinor is on point. The amenities are great . The experience is very hommie , every time you discover little details that make a difference in your stay.   If you’re looking for something local, not loud ,  away from tourists this is definitely a good location.",1.0
Chicago,"Ellie’s place is so so wonderful! Chic, stylish, beautiful location from which you can easily access the trendiest Chicago area, Wicker Park. Ellie responds in mere minutes should you need anything and the keypad entry makes it so easy to come and go as you please, no need for keys! 10/10 would recommend and hope to stay here again! ❤️",1.0
Chicago,"Beautiful decor with so much space! Instructions for checkin were easy to follow. The coffee and extras were great!  Very comfortable bed! The apartment has an urban ambiance. Jeremy provided parking passes and we were able to find parking a block away. Communication was excellent. Jeremy answered any questions I had almost immediately. Neighborhood had a safe feel. We walked to local restaurants close by. One unfortunate thing, which was no fault of our host- when we went to leave, we discoveredthat our catalytic converter was stolen off of our car. I had driven our older SUV since I knew it would be parked for several days. Turns out, these are easiervehicles to get under and cut. I would not hesitate to stay here again.",1.0
Chicago,"This Airbnb is the best! Location and space are the key highlights! Jeremy has great design taste! Close to the train and many restaurants. We would definitely stay here again! If you’re visiting, try the rolled ice cream across the street! We had it twice!",1.0
Chicago,"The apartment was absolutely fantastic and everything was as good as advertised. The entire unit was much more spacious than it appeared in the photos which was a welcomed surprise as I have stayed in several Airbnb's that were smaller than photographed.   You could not ask for a better location, one block from the blue line which made traveling to/from O'Hare and into downtown a breeze. You're also within walking distance to countless top notch restaurants and shops.  Jeremy was a very responsive and accommodating host and he really made us feel taken care of when we had some flight plan changes. I would recommend this apartment to anyone wanting to visit Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"There is much to like about this apartment.  It's spacious, has full amenities, plenty of character, parking is included, and the place is clean.  Wicker Park is growing, has a unique vibe, feels safe, and offers options within walking distance for groceries.  The area also has many choices for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and drinks.  We chose to use the kitchen for breakfast, and the waffle maker was a great perk.  A critical factor in comfort, rest and relaxation is the bed.  While clean, we found the mattress to be uncomfortable.  It currently presents itself as firm and lumpy with indentations and sag from years of use.  Upgrading this one very important item would make this location, apartment, and experience worth renting again.  We enjoyed our stay overall and will keep this as an option in the future.",1.0
Chicago,"Came to Chicago for my cousin's birthday party. It was in my old neighborhood, so I felt very much at home. The place was spacious and exactly how it was described! I briefly meet Jeremy when I arrived, he was extremely nice. Would love to come back here when I visit Chicago again.",1.0
Chicago,"I loved this loft and everything about it.  The location was great - 1.5 blocks from the CTA - we were able to explore the entire city using public transportation.  Check in and check out were a breeze.  Jeremy was kind and offered great suggestions when we met briefly during the stay.  The apartment was spotlessly clean, comfortable, quiet and well appointed.  This was my first visit to Chicago and I would gladly stay here on my next trip.",1.0
Chicago,"We loved this place. It's spacious and very convenient. If you have small children, you may want to know that there is a firehouse nearby, but it did not bother us, we expected city noises. There's a Metro station barely a block away. It's great to have a washer and dryer right in the apartment since we tend to pack very lightly. We greatly appreciated the neighborhood parking stickers Jeremey provided and we easily found parking about 1 block away on a safe, residential street. We'll stay here again next time we're in town.",1.0
Chicago,"This is a large, 1 bedroom apartment within 2 blocks of the blue line. Very convenient! There’s a well equipped full kitchen with a small grocery across the street. Of course there a numerous great restaurants in the area so there’s no need to cook. The apartment was very comfortable and clean. We had plenty of pillows, blankets, towels etc. which was much appreciated.",1.0
Chicago,"This was my very first AirBnB and if all of them are like this one, I'll never stay in a hotel again. Jeremey's communication was excellent from start to finish and his home is so beautiful and immaculate. It is easy to find and right off the blue line. The home had EVERYTHING I needed and then some. He even left me 2 day parking passes for the area which made people coming by easy to park nearby. It is in a very cool neighborhood and as a single woman staying in an area I've never been, I felt very safe. When I visit again, I would definitely stay there again.",1.0
Chicago,Jeremey is a wonderful host and his place is extremely nice. He is quick to respond with any questions and is willing to give recommendations around the city. The place was clean and decorated with care. It has everything you would need during your stay.,1.0
Chicago,"Jeremy's apartment is exactly as advertised - stylish, large, comfortable and spotlessly clean in a very safe, hip neighborhood.  The kitchen has all you would need to fix your own meals.  We, however, opted to take advantage of the multitude of excellent bars, coffee shops and restaurants within very easy walking distance on Division Street and North Milwaukee Avenue (for lovers of high quality Nepalese / Indian food we recommend Cumin on North Milwaukee). Communication with Jeremy was very easy.  If and when we return to this part of Chicago Wicker we would, without hesitation choose to stay in Jeremy's place.",1.0
Chicago,"We were very pleased with the apartment. With an updated modern kitchen and bathroom we had everything we needed to be comfortable. Jeremy was a great host, communicated all details we needed when needed.",1.0
Chicago,Jeremy's place was fantastic! It is really big. Was great to unpack and have space and feel at home. Really close to the blue line. Easy to get anywhere. Felt safe in the neighborhood. Fire station next door but never bothered us or woke us up. Would definitely stay again!,1.0
Chicago,Our stay was great! Jeremey was very responsive when we asked him about accommodating our two dogs during the stay. There was even a small crate provided that we ended up using for the smaller pup. Everything was just as described and the apartment is close to many great restaurants and shops. We'd stay again! :),1.0
Chicago,"Jeremey's place is fantastic -- it's bigger than we were expecting and has a really nice overall feel to it.  It's nicely decorated and has all the amenities you would need.  Jeremey was very quick to respond to messages and helped out if anything at all was needed.  Check-in was simple and the building felt secure.  It's just a couple minutes' walk to the blue line, which brings you right into downtown in about 10 minutes.  Also close to some cool spots on N Milwaukee, like Oiistar, the amazing ramen place.  Super nice experience and we'd definitely stay with Jeremey again!",1.0
Chicago,"This was perfect for our needs.  Everything was as advertised.  It's a beautiful space and the location is great.  (Ashland itself is not too appealing but you're a one-minute walk from blue line, can stroll west on Division or walk up Milwaukee Ave to Bucktown.).  Self-checkin was super easy and we had everything we needed.",1.0
Chicago,"Jeremy was very responsive, answering all questions quickly and thoroughly.  His place was nice and very clean.  My parents stayed at the Air BnB to visit me and were quite pleased.  Being that I own and live in downtown Chicago, I can say that this location fantastic and the price to be a great value.",1.0
Chicago,This place is one of the nicest accommodations I have ever stayed at. Yes the price is expensive compared to a hotel but if you want a solid night's sleep and little slice of home be sure to check out Jeremy's place!,1.0
Chicago,Wonderful place.  We really enjoyed ourselves and relaxed at Jeremey's loft.  Very clean.  We enjoyed being able to watch people on the streets from the loft.  Love the mixture of cultures which we don't get much of back home.  Location was great.  Very quick walk to get to Wicker Park and many great local restaurants as well.  Felt very safe in the neighborhood and at Jeremey's place.  Super nice people.  Jeremey is fantastic at returning messages.  Always a quick reply and we had no problems at all that couldn't be fixed quickly.  Highly recommend Jeremey's loft!,1.0
Chicago,"Jeremey's apartment far exceeded our expectations.  The pictures don't do justice to how beautiful, stylish and very spacious this place is, not to mention comfortable and clean.  Everything was simply perfect.  Every possible amenity to make you feel right at home--we wanted for nothing.  Comfortable bed and couches, beautiful, roomy bathroom with large shower and plenty of hot water, fully stocked kitchen, excellent wi-fi and incredibly easy check-in process. We loved the location, merely 2 short blocks (roughly 3 min) walk to the Blue line on the L/ subway.  So easy to get to the main attractions downtown, but also in a great spot to explore the Wicker Park/ West Town neighborhoods and all the great restaurants and shops.  An excellent Airbnb experience--Thank you, Jeremey!!",1.0
Chicago,We found it exactly as advertised—perhaps even better. Super accommodations in a great location. Jeremey was very accessible and promptly responded to our requests and questions. We look forward to staying there again on our next trip to Chicago.,1.0
Chicago,We LOVED the location. The area seemed very safe and was central to the blue line and a Divvy bike station. (Tip: take the blue line to and from O’hare to save a lot of money on transportation) The apartment was very roomy and we enjoyed having access to a kitchen. Something to note is the TV does not have cable or “smart” access. We ended up buying a firestick so we had something to watch while winding down at the end of our days. Jeremy was quick to respond any time we had questions or needed anything! Thank you for a great stay!,1.0
Chicago,"Better than it looked online, a beautiful space with everything needed and then some. Great location, close to public transportation and wonderful local spots. Jeremy was attentive and helpful with all of my queries. Would stay here whenever I’m in Chicago. Can’t recom enough!",1.0
Chicago,"This is a beautiful unit in a great neighborhood in Chicago.  Jeremy was a great host and was easy to communicate with.  Check-in and check-out were a breeze and the apartment was spotless.  It's on a busy street but there was very little noise.  The blue line is a block away as are Target, CVS and a bunch of great coffee shops and places to eat.  Also super easy to pick up a cab or an Uber/Lyft.  Would recommend this place without hesitation!",1.0
Chicago,Communication was fast and easy and Jeremey was available every step of the way.    Apartment was better than I expected.  Great location and very close to the Blue Line which can get you just about anywhere.     Would absolutely recommend and would stay here again in the future.   ,1.0
Chicago,"This is a spacious apartment and very nicely furnished. The location is just a few minutes walk from the blue line with quick transportation direct to the heart of downtown. Check-in was easy and the host provided a sheet with lots of helpful suggestions for local eating places, of which there are many.  Staying at Jeremey's place for 4 nights provided a very comfortable place to stay for our tired bodies after spending our days exploring Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,Jeremey’s place is very spacious and clean.  It has everything you need for a short or long term stay.  Jeremey is very nice and answers any question very promptly.  The location is also very convenient for travel on public transport.  Highly recommended!,1.0
Chicago,"Couldn't have asked for a better place. It was super easy to get to and from both town and O'Hare, with a Blue Line stop only one block away. It was beautiful and cheerful as well. Loved the full kitchen and nice extra-large tub. Jeremey was a lovely host. I wish we could have stayed even longer!",1.0
Chicago,"Great location with convenient transportation. The neighborhood has a cool vibe. As a vinyl record collector, I was excited about being across the street from Dusty Groove and close to Reckless Records. Great overall experience.",1.0
Chicago,"My wife and I spent 2 nights at Jeremey's place. While pictures can often be deceiving, we were pleasantly surprised at how large and open the apartment was in person. It was perfect. Jeremey was traveling in Spain at the time, but he was quick to respond to questions we had the day of and during the trip about things such as checking in and adjusting the nest thermostat. We'd happily stay there again.",1.0
Chicago,Great space in a convenient location—a vibrant neighborhood and just a block from blue line. The apartment has a good vibe and personality and is very clean. Jeremy was attentive and responsive. I’ll go back.,1.0
Chicago,"Jeremey's apartment is really great. It's large and bright in all the right places (and quieter and darker in the bedroom, which is lovely for sleeping), stylishly decorated (without being overdone--the decor fits the urban space perfectly), has a fantastic shower, everything you need for a comfortable stay and is in one of my favorite Chicago neighborhoods, with a bajiggety restaurants, bars, shops, etc. The provided parking passes are super helpful, especially for weekend stays, because parking in this part of the city is no joke (in fact, if you can manage without a car, do, because you won't need it once you're here--everything is walkable, lyft/uber is plentiful and the El train is literally right there.)  If mobility is an issue for you, you should know that you have to walk up a flight of steep, narrow stairs to get to the apartment. Also, it's really in the real city, and real cities generally aren't that quiet, so if you're a super sensitive sleeper who needs deep, dark silence, you'll maybe want to bring ear plugs and/or a sleep mask.   But otherwise, I completely recommend this place. Jeremey is a kind, helpful and responsive host, the apartment is so lovely, and it's a really great value for Chicago, too.",1.0
Chicago,"We enjoyed our stay at Jeremy’s place. It's conveniently located, about 15 minutes to the loop and 20 minutes to Midway airport. Although we got around with Uber, the blue line is just minutes across the street. The apartment is super clean and lovely decorated. Jeremy is very thoughtful with the travel guide and tips. It was great to meet a Cal alumni at Chicago. =) I would recommend this listing to everyone.",1.0
Chicago,"This home was great. Jeremey provided easy check in details and instructions. The location was great because I was close to everything downtown and many shops and stores. I recommend this home and would certainly stay here again. Thanks again, Jeremey!",1.0
Chicago,"Jeremy was easily accessible for any questions via text and he even checked in the second day to make sure everything was okay. The apartment spacious, comfortable and centrally located. Just a few steps to the blue line CTA train, restaurants and shops. The neighborhood is busy so the provided parking permits were a huge plus.",1.0
Chicago,"This space is amazing. Plenty of room, furnishings are great, kitchen has everything you could need, and the shower was perfect after a long day of exploring Chicago in the cold. Jeremey was prompt with responses and great about giving me tips on places to check out. Literally just a few steps away from the Blue Line which made getting around the city super easy. I will definitely be looking to get this place again next time I am in Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"Great place! We stayed there with our 18month during our summer holiday trip, all three of us loved Jeremey’s place. Bigger than expected. Jeremey was very supportive and fast with all kind of questions. We can highly recommend this place, also when you are traveling with small children.",1.0
Chicago,"What a great stay in Chicago!!! Jeremey‘s loft is perfectly situated in one of our favourite areas within Chicago. There are so many things to explore in walking distance: restaurants, shopping, parks, and the great 606 trail. The train („L“, blue line) - which is more or less directly in front of the apartment - connects you directly with downtown as well as with the airport. The apartment is so cool, we would love to live there! Despite the busy street in front of the house the apartments inside is so quiet and we slept like babies. Jeremey is a fantastic host and helped us a lot to find our ways, gave us great recommendations and answered immediately whenever we wrote a message. We will definitely come again!!!",1.0
Chicago,"A very spacious and spotlessly clean apartment, it holds special charm with bare brick walls and wooden floors with plenty of seating and a very large bed with a well equipped dressing room.  The bathroom is great with a very impressive bath for easing away the muscles after a long day of exploring.  We didn’t use the kitchen much apart from making a hot drink as we ate out most of the time but there is a great health food shop just opposite and a food shop just by the subway station.  Although we didn’t get to meet Jeremey his communication with us was superb.",1.0
Chicago,"Jeremy’s place is amazing, not only is it huge, it has everything you need for a comfortable stay, it’s in a great location for getting around town (literally one minute walk from the blue line at Division), and really easy to get to on the blue line from O’hare airport.  Jeremy was a fantastic host, very quick to respond to any queries we had, and was kind enough to let us leave our bags for a couple of hours while we went for brunch before heading back to the airport.  I would highly recommend his apartment to anyone wanting to explore Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,We had a very nice stay at Jeremy’s Airbnb. Lots of space and a big kitchen. Jeremy responds quickly to questions and everything went very smooth. It is in a good location if you want to explore Wicker Park.,1.0

The apartment is wonderful, the area is well connected and I would stay here again In a heartbeat. ",1.0
Chicago,"Jeremey’s place is so beautiful, a perfect loft you could imagine with a view to a quiet street. It has lots of light, in the morning or in the evening too. Subway is 1 minute walking distance (literally)! Fire station in the adjacent building is not bothering at all, they turned out to be the most quiet neighbors we ever had :) Many thanks to Jeremey, we would like to return!",1.0
Chicago,Beautiful apartment thats is decorated to perfection. Its conveniently located (10 min walk to wicker park and 20 min subway to downtown). Jeremy was very accommodating and his local coffee & donut tips were great!,1.0
Chicago,"Rob’s place was beautiful! It looked exactly as advertised. The apartment was spacious & stylishly decorated. Lots of restaurants & bars within walking distance, as well as a grocery store. Rob was super responsive & hospitable. We were not able to check in before 3, but he allowed us to leave our luggage in his store prior to check in & even took it upstairs to the apartment for us! The only downside was that the bedroom can get a little warm, especially on a hot summer day. Other than that, we fully enjoyed our stay. Would definitely stay here again!",1.0
Chicago,"Rob’s Place was beautifully furnished and decorated. It was also only a 3 minute walk from the nearest bus stop which can take you to downtown or any of the metro/L lines - very convenient. The only downside is that there is no air conditioning in the bedroom so it got really hot. It is also on the 3rd floor so that’s something to consider if you don’t like taking the stairs. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and would recommend it!",1.0
Chicago,Rob's place is immaculate! I have never seen an Airbnb so tastefully decorated and cozy. Its in the middle of a bustling restaurant and shopping district but is surprisingly quiet. Rob himself was very responsive and a great host. I would definitely come back here for sure. Make sure you take advantage of the $20/day parking that Rob offers. It was a lifesaver.,1.0
Chicago,"My experience could not have been better. This was the mog immaculate, stylish, modern, and comfortable AirBnB experience I've ever had. The owner has spared no expense, from stainless steel alliances to remodeled bathrooms and showers, to new wood flooring. The temper-pedic bed was heavenly, and the furnishings were modern and comfortable. The attention to detail was unparalleled, from train maps and restaurant guides to Chicago artwork and plenty of cooking utensils and supplies, as well as beauty and hygiene products. I was beyond impressed with the level of care and consideration.   When I return to Chicago in the future, this will be my first choice. Always.",1.0
Chicago,We were In Chicago to see Hamilton and sightsee with our teenaged daughter. We loved this location and neighborhood. It felt safe and there were tons of nearby places to eat or get groceries. The condo itself was extremely clean and was well stocked with necessities. It was spacious and we never felt crowded. Rob was a great host and was very responsive to our questions. It was a plus to have  parking available as we never moved our car until we left Chicago. I would definitely rent from Rob again,1.0
Chicago,"Rob's place is incredibly stylish, supremely located, and overall provides a comfortable, beautiful perch from which to explore the city of Chicago.  As a host, Rob was incredibly hospitable and communicative, and was very helpful in getting me situated for the stay.  I highly recommend the apartment and would definitely stay here again!",1.0
Chicago,"This place is a fantastic stay!  Everything is wonderfully decorated, well thought-out, very clean, and it has an authenticity you can only find in a beautiful historic building.  The location is great as well. It’s a 13 minute drive to downtown Chicago, and 500 feet from the best breakfast place in town “Whisk”. You must go there!  Only thing missing in the Airbnb was coffee, so you may want to bring your own. But they have multiple ways to make it if you do.  Great stay, highly recommend this Airbnb!",1.0
Chicago,My wife and I came in to Chicago for our wedding anniversary and are so glad we chose to stay with Rob.  Probably the best Airbnb experience we’ve had.  He really thinks of everything and we can’t recommend staying here enough.,1.0
Chicago,Rob’ s space is 5 stars & beyond. He has gone the extra steps to make his guests well informed about the neighborhood & totally took care of everything you need to be comfortable away from your home.

Chicago,"By far-this Rob's place is the most STUNNING home my husband and I stayed in. The décor is stylish, modern and pure class. The Holiday decorations made it festive and cozy. I really want those flocked trees!! LOL Absolutely gorgeous. The pictures of this listing does it NO JUSTICE!! Rob is a delight and one of thee most gracious hosts I have encountered. His level of hospitality is unparalleled and he gave us some great suggestions of local eateries in the area. His home is in great proximity to downtown and other neighborhoods. We truly could not be more pleased and dreaded leaving to return back to our home state. However, we will certainly be back and definitely in the process of making plans to book Rob's home again. You will not be disappointed!! Truly his home is a GEM!!!",1.0
Chicago,"The warmest home we've ever been in. Sparkling clean, modern and superb interior design, great location and a very lovely, warm host. Thank you, Rob and we promise to only stay at your place whenever we're in Chicago! An experience to remember!",1.0
Chicago,"This was the cleanest Airbnb we’ve ever stayed in. If you are picky with finding a clean place that actually FEELS clean, this home is for you. You can immediately tell that Rob takes pride in his apartment and everything is so well maintained and stylishly decorated. The bed was a welcomed place for rest after a long day, and we loved how firm the mattress was and how fluffy the pillows were—very comfortable.  The amenities were spot on, the coffeemaker, the gas stove, plenty of dishes and quality cookware to use for making a meal. Not mention, the exceptional decor of the entire apartment! The location was excellent and walkable to numerous local restaurants and bars (a few were literally steps from the apartment door). We loved being on the third floor and always felt super safe. There is some traffic noise that can be heard in the bedroom, but Rob provides earplugs for light sleepers. In truth, we actually enjoyed being lulled to sleep by the sounds of the city and it didn’t bother us at all. The convenience of the grocery store being a 5 minute walk away made buying some pantry and fridge essentials easy. The couch in the living room was super comfy and perfect for relaxing and watching the Thanksgiving Day parade and some Netflix Christmas movies. This was the perfect Airbnb and we were highly impressed (not always easy). 5 stars to Rob for such an amazingly clean, comfortable, stylish, and well thought out home away from home. We’ll be back soon!",1.0
Chicago,"This place is so much nicer in person! And wow the bed was so comfortable we ended up sleeping the first night we got there instead of going out because we got trapped in the bed lol. Communicating with Rob was very easy and his home was supplied with everything!! First aid kit, make up remover wipes you name it lol. The home is in a very quiet and safe neighborhood. Would definitely stay again, one of the nicest places I have ever stayed!",1.0
Chicago,"We had a short but wonderful stay at Rob's place for a weekend trip to Chicago. Communication and check-in were quick and easy, and it was a breeze to get there from the airport on the train and a bus.  The space was spotlessly clean and beautifully furnished, with thoughtful touches that made our stay really comfortable. The location is great too, with a grocery store nearby and lots of good food/drink options as well.  Our only regrets are that we didn't stay here longer to enjoy it more and that we had to catch a Sunday morning flight before we could peruse the beautiful store downstairs some more. We would definitely stay here again, and will happily recommend it to any family and friends who may be looking for a place to stay in Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"Rob’s apartment was exactly what we need for a wonderful stay in Chicago. It was styled beautifully and Rob provided everything we could possibly need- thought of everything! Only note to future guests is that it is on the third floor, so keep this mind when packing large luggage. I would highly recommend Rob and his apartment!",1.0
Chicago,"Rob’s place is one of the nicest, best located, and real value of all the places we have stayed!  It is tastefully furnished, very clean, modern, and had everything we needed to feel at home, including a fully-equipped kitchen.  Conveniently located to all the sites we wanted to see.  Also, close to a supermarket which was handy, and few steps to dozens of restaurants and cafes.  Rob was always quick to respond to my questions.  We highly recommend this wonderful apartment!  Looking forward to staying here next time we visit Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"The best place I’ve ever stayed at! Decorated to the 9s, home included everything I never even thought of - including band aids and bath salts for a lovely soak!

There’s a grocery store right nearby and nice shops and restaurants for a true neighborhood experience. I was in town for a conference and it was a quick drive or bus/train into the Loop. I will most certainly stay here again.",1.0
Chicago,"This might be my favorite Airbnb stay to date. The apartment so stunning, clean, and comfortable and charming Ukrainian Village with so much to offer, we chose to make fewer trips into the heart of the city to spend more time enjoying and exploring the immediate surroundings both in and out of the apartment. Yoga, restaurants, shops, grocery...everything within walking distance and this little oasis to temporarily call home. Rob couldn’t have been a better host. Will be back for sure!",1.0
Chicago,Rob’s place was amazing. Right in the center of everything. The location was close to many restaurants and bars. It is also a short ride to surrounding neighborhoods and downtown. The place itself was amazing with all the amenities needed for a great stay. Rob was prompt in his communication and was right below if needed. The parking space was a bonus as it is hard to find parking in this neighborhood without a permit.,1.0
Chicago,"Location, atmosphere, beautiful decor, every thought to amenities (even a First Aid Kit!)... you simply can't go wrong with this great condo in Ukrainian Village.  It was a snowy weekend so we especially enjoyed the cabinet full of games!  We were visiting family in Streeterville and getting there was no problem at all.  Rob greeted us when I arrived, and check-out was very simple.  Also, my brother drove over from a neighboring city to meet me, so we appreciated the off-street parking for him and his daughter.  Stay with Rob!  You won't regret it.",1.0
Chicago,"This is a stylish, modern yet comfortable apartment located in a cool part of town with lots of options to dine and a young at heart hip vibe.  I felt like a movie star in the surroundings & was happy to find out that the amazing shop below actually sold some of the items that are featured in the living space. It is located on an active street on the 3rd floor of a recently enovated building.  Rob is extremely responsive and a caring host.  I look forward to staying there again!",1.0

The only concern was the road noise at night.",1.0

Very clean and in a great location. 10/10 would recommend!",1.0
Chicago,"This was our first AirBNB and I gave 5 stars all the way through. Chris was an amazing host. Quick responses and clear communication. Super helpful with us as we learned to navigate city, food and parking. Being from a rural area, we were grateful to have the help! Maps on fridge. Nice residential area, felt safe even at night. Extremely clean. Special touches such as video games and snacks. Went above and beyond to provide a welcoming and safe environment. Room was stylized, modern. Plenty of amenities, even access to laundry. If we make our way back to town, we’ll stay here again. Thank you for making our first AirBNB memorable!",1.0
Chicago,"Great place to stay! Very clean and convenient to food and shops! Reminded me of being Ina little apartment. The shower was a bit small, so if you're a larger person it may be difficult to fit. But it was a very nice place and the host were quick to respond.",1.0

The decor is fantastic and we loved many of the little touches including the board games, tasteful art, game systems, and the water and drinks in the fridge were a welcome surprise after our evening arrival. Having central heat as well as a space heater in the unit helped make sure we stayed nice and toasty during our visit. We didn't take advantage of them, but the fact that a washer and dryer were available was a nice bonus.   We'll definitely look here first on our next trip to Chicago!",1.0

Chicago,"What a gem! Christopher’s place was exactly as described including a ton of extras. Christopher was quick to respond before and during my stay. He left a light on for me the night I arrived since I had a super late flight. He even checked in on me the next day to make sure I had everything I needed. The place was totally spotless. The bed was very comfy and there were tons of extra pillows. The kitchen was fully equipped and he even stocked it with several quick food items. These were much appreciated especially the first morning. The space felt so much more roomy than I was expecting. Ceilings are a bit lower being a garden unit but I had no problem at all with it. The water pressure in the shower was really great. Christopher made a really detailed welcome guide with lots of great info abt the neighborhood. The studio is only 3 short blocks away from a bus that takes you directly to the belmont el station (abt a 20-30 min ride). I felt very safe in the neighborhood (family vibe) even when coming in using transit late at night by myself. If you are wanting to do a lot of things in the Loop, transit took me 45-hour sometimes depending on the time of day. This was not a big deal for me bc I wanted a neighborhood experience vs more of a downtown touristy one, but it did take longer to get to and from. Lastly, Christopher was kind enough to  hold my luggage for me on my last day since I had a later flight. All in all, fantastic experience and I highly recommend this listing. Thank you so much, Christopher!",1.0

Chicago,This is such a great place to stay! Awesome location between the airport and downtown. Uber’s were always there within 5 minutes and were reasonably priced for a ride to anywhere in the city.

Transportation was nearby and made our rides to the city very convinient, also we got to explore more of it by using transportation.

Chicago,Chris was an amazing host.  His place was very clean and better than we expected.  This was the wife’s first time visiting Chicago and she wasn’t disappointed as this place offers a lot of space for two guests.  Parking on the same street was hit and miss but that can be expected for a big city.  We took Lyft anytime we were visiting downtown Chicago.  It was nice to come and go as we pleased.  Chris responded very quickly to any messages that were sent.  I felt safe enough walking in the general neighborhood.  When we visit Chicago again this would definitely be the first choice.  Our first host cancelled which brought us to finding this gem.,1.0

Chicago,"I can't give Christopher enough praise! This was absolutely perfect for our first trip to Chicago and the basement studio was just wonderful! Not only was it incredibly clean, stocked with snacks and home-y touches, but it was very comfortable and Christopher was an amazing host.

The space was well appointed, very comfortable and squeaky clean. We would absolutely stay there again!",1.0
Chicago,"Christopher’s place was everything we expected and more! It was just as it’s shown in the photos but better. I was surprised at how sparkly clean and well kept the Airbnb was especially seeing as it’s popular and guests stay often.

I’ll definitely be coming back!",1.0

Chicago,"Chris' place is really lovely! Plenty of space for 2 people, with lots of thoughtful touches like biscuits, bottled water, tea and coffee etc! The kitchen was well equipped to make meals, and Chris quickly provided a can opener when we asked to borrow one. The washer and dryer in the apartment were also very handy. Good location in a residential neighbourhood, about 10-15 min walk to the local Aldi and 10 mins to shops, including the currency exchange to get bus tickets. 5 mins walk from the bus stop that takes you to the blue line, which then takes you to O'hare airport or downtown. It takes around an hour to get to the Museum campus, and about 45 mins to attractions like the Skydeck and Hancock Tower. Chris recommended an architecture boat tour which was fab. Communication was always fast and helpful, would definitely recommend!",1.0

Chicago,"Samantha’s place was perfect for our short stay! It was very clean, stylish and cozy. The small, secluded patio was a sweet surprise. Only things to note- the stairs are very steep and the neighbors have a puppy, which was loud when we came in after a concert during quiet hours. Check in instructions were thorough and easy! We would love to stay again.",1.0
Chicago,"Samantha's apartment was clean, cozy, and had great lighting. She was kind enough to let us store our luggage when we arrived early.

Chicago,"Samantha’s place is modern cute chic. Every piece of furniture is well thought out with aesthetic and function in mind. The steps to the loft bedroom: first, it’s very roomy up there and cozy. The steps itself could be problematic for people who are afraid of heights but for someone like me who is uncoordinated, it was surprisingly easy to navigate. Although, I didn’t need anything, Samantha made me feel like she was only an email/text/phone call away if I needed assistance or info. Also, there’s a small but very cute balcony where u can enjoy your morning coffee.",1.0
Chicago,Fun spot to serve as base camp to explore Chicago as you can reach a bunch of fun neighborhoods inside of 30 min. The unit itself was extremely clean and Samantha was super responsive. The lock box makes check in and out simple. Added touches like the full kitchen and French press are a bonus. ,1.0
Chicago,"I had a great stay at Samantha's. The space was lovely and very clean. I didnt spend much time here because I like to explore when I visit a new place, but I appreciated the relaxing and simple vibe of the space at the end of a long day. Samantha and I communicated via text and I found her to be very kind and accommodating regarding a specific inquiry that I had. If you're looking and this place is free, book it now!",1.0
Chicago,"Samantha's place was the perfect place to explore logan square, we used to live in the city and hadn't done much exploring there.

We got awesome suggestions on places to eat and drink and it doesn't take too long to get into the city. 10/10 would recommend!!",1.0
Chicago,"Samantha & Jonathan's loft was exactly as pictured, and located in a convenient location. I loved the apartment - I would love to live here myself! The stairs to the loft was quite steep as others describe, and I left my suitcase downstairs and only went upstairs to sleep. The bed was very comfortable. My friend whom I stayed with wanted an easy access to the bathroom during night, so she decided to use the air mattress downstairs, which we found in the closet (we moved furnitures around to make space). The walk to the California CTA station was 15-20 min for me, but since it was quite a cold week, I often opted for Uber. As we had packed plans in downtown, we did not get to explore much of the neighborhood nor get to ask for neighborhood tips that Samantha was happy to share, but I'd love to come back to this loft and explore more!",1.0
Chicago,"The loft is located in a great quiet spot that is walking distance from great restaurants and bars. It was a ~15 minute walk from both the Logan Square and California blue line stops, and extremely close to tons and tons of good restaurants and bars (check out Lula, Giant, and Longman & Eagle). Samantha was a great host and the place was spotless when we arrived, with tea and some nice snacks sitting on the table. Checking in and out was as easy and quick as it gets, and we appreciated Samantha periodically messaging us to check on our experience. We would stay here again in a heartbeat. Our only warning is that all the stairs in the building are extremely steep and narrow. We didn't have any problems, but you should be careful. Overall a 5/5 experience.",1.0
Chicago,"The space is exactly as pictured.  Simple, basic, perfect for one or two people.  The bed in the loft was comfortable and the HDTV had plenty of premium channels.  The neighborhood is quiet and we felt safe.  Parking on the street wasn't an issue for us, but it did seem to be full in the evening.  Major bus line is 3 blocks away that will take you straight to the northside Fullerton train stops and the Blue Line station that goes to the loop is about 8 blocks away.  The host is easily reached and communication was great.  Thanks!",1.0
Chicago,"I enjoyed my stay in this space! The studio itself was very clean and quiet during sleeping hours. The staircase to the bed was a little steeper than I had expected, but it was sturdy and I got used to it. It was in a lovely location that had access to buses and trains. I did do a bit of walking, but that was my choice. Samantha and Jonathan were quick with communication and gave suggestions for the area. I would stay again. Thanks!",1.0

We would definitely stay here again. Thank you!",1.0
Chicago,"Samantha's place is absolutely marvelous! It's located in a nice residential area, with some fun bars and restaurants in the neighborhood. If you don't want to wait for a bus, it's a bit of a walk to the blue line, but nothing bad. Uber rides into the city were not that expensive and an easy way to get into the city. The apartment itself is really, really nice. Clean, spacious and an extremely comfy bed. I would highly recommend it to anybody!",1.0
Chicago,A very stylish flat with lots of complimentary toiletries and helpful guide books for the area. The flat isn’t in the city centre but taking an Uber carpool is a cheap and easy way of getting into the main part.,1.0
Chicago,This is a beautifully-designed loft apartment in an upmarket part of town.  It is sparkling clean and has some nice touches such as local coffee. Communication with Samantha was very smooth and she answered our questions quickly.  I would highly recommend staying here in Chicago.,1.0
Chicago,"Lovely apartment in a great area of the city.  Local amenities were perfect (I'd recommend Tony's for any grocery requirement and Wyler Road for a chilled drink and a bit to eat!) and not too far from the ""L"" to the Loop where it's a 20 min ride in.   Hosts were great and very responsive to any request and requirement we had and helped out as much as possible.  The stairs up to the mezzanine are definitely steep but we expected this from the description so not a problem at all and the apartment is carefully thought out to give maximum usability of the space.  Overall a fantastic expperience of this amazing city.",1.0
Chicago,"Place was amazing! My boyfriend and I absolutely loved our stay here in this loft. Area is very clean and very stylish. All of our questions were answered very fast and accurately. Everything was supplied for us, they even had Q-tips lol. ",1.0
Chicago,"We had an amazing stay at Samantha's place. It is located in a quiet neighborhood within 20min walking distance from the blue line. The apartment is spacious and has everything you need including cooking facilities, big comfortable bed, tv etc. We were a bit delayed and arrived late in the evening, but Samantha was extremely kind by helping us ordering pizza while we were absolutely wrecked from traveling. Furthermore, she always responded very quickly to questions from us. We ran in to her husband Jonathan a couple of times who was also super friendly and gave us a ton of advice on what to do in the city. Overall we had a great couple of days in Chicago and we definitely recommend this place! ",1.0
Chicago,"Samantha's place was perfect for our weekend getaway. Travel around the city was very convenient with transit and biking options very closeby. The space was extremely tidy and comfortable, and our hosts were very accommodating...thanks for a wonderful Chicago experience!",1.0
Chicago,"This apartment is great! The apartment itself is already beautiful and special with its high ceilings, and the location is also very nice. In walking distance from Logan square, with nice coffee bars, restaurants, shops and street art. But also in walking distance from public transport that takes you to downtown in just a few stops. We would definitely recommend this place for a great visit to this great city",1.0
Chicago,"Lovely loft studio, spotlessly clean and very well designed with everything we needed. Location is good with the metro about 15 mins walk away then 20 mins to downtown, and a Chicago bike scheme station 5mins away and an even quicker cycle to downtown. We also enjoyed the 606 trail, Chicago's answer to the Highline which is also close by.  So a great place and a great location.",1.0
Chicago,Beautiful apartment in quite neighborhood. The space is great it's location relative to public transit is awesome. Samantha was quick to respond to any questions. I will definitely be checking availability next time I'm back in Chicago.,1.0
Chicago,"We had a great stay at Logan Square. The appartment was spacious (more so than we expected) and very clean with thoughtful provisions provided.   Samantha and Jonathon provided us with a great list of nearby places do eat and drink (from fresh coffee to pizza) and were very helpful in communicating when we asked for help.   Logan Sqaure itself is a lovely leafy neighbourhood around half an hr from Downtown on the train. There's plenty of amenities a short walk from the appartment, as well as loads of great bars. A taxi into Downtown is quicker but more expensive.   The 'L' (elevated train) is a 15-20 min walk from the appt and then a further 15 min or so ride into downtown where there is plenty to do. A weekly ticket for the train is around $30 and gives you access to trains and buses. Very handy for getting around as the bus and L system is easy to use.  On a clear day, we would recommend hiring a bike and taking the Lake Shore route which runs alongside Lake Michigan. You get stunning views of the iconic skyscrapers from across the water.  Hancock Tower on a clear day is also a must see too, with great views for miles.  If the weather is cooler, then there are loads of great museums to visit. the History of Chicago by Lincoln Park is great. The Old Town is nearby for a drink afterwards too.  Definitely a great city to visit with lots to do, and a great appartment in a great neighbourhood. 10/10  Thanks",1.0
Chicago,"The apartment was lovely, clean, and the coffee/snacks were appreciated. The security within the apartment was great, and although the surrounding area was less confidence-inspiring, she had us send a photo of our car once we arrived, and the area had cameras, so it put me at ease. We were super close to both bus and train options that we utilized several times, and within walking distance of target for quick pick-ups. We enjoyed our stay!",1.0
Chicago,"Kay is the best superhost you will ever have!! She is great with communication and is very welcoming! Her apartment has a home-like feeling that will make your vacation even better. Cleanest place ever!! Absolutely spotless and smells amazing!!  If you are looking for suggestions of where to eat and shop, Kay will give you a list of her favorite places and provides a variety brochures, pamphlets, flyers, and food menu’s! I had mentioned my family was vegan and she gave me options of food choices around the area!  Great location!!! I highly recommend staying at Kay’s place if you are visiting Chicago!!",1.0
Chicago,"Kay’s place was very cute and clean!! She was super quick to respond to anything. The train is a quick walk from the apartment though I don’t think I would personally feel safe walking from the train tooo late at night as a young lady. Loved how she  had treats available like bananas, it’s, orange juice, coffee. It is very convenient for a quick trip to downtown Chicago!",1.0
Chicago,"Even though Kay's place was more on the south side of Chicago and I was going to the north side for a Cubs game, her place was great for a one-night stay with how reasonably priced it was right before Memorial Day weekend. I just got ubers to get to and from the game rather than public transit. Kay's place was very comfortable and she was a great host!",1.0
Chicago,"Kay’s place was amazing! Such thoughtful, kind touches, and Kay is super communicative. Seriously, this room was nicer and more well-equipped than some of the luxury hotel’s I’ve stayed at. 100% would stay here again!",1.0
Chicago,"From the extreme cleanliness of the apartment to the added extras everywhere you turn, this place was absolutely perfect! The host is respectful and generous with the most friendly senior kitty ever! Coming “home” to a snuggly feline in the living room was probably the best thing ever (I’m an extreme cat person). However, if you’re not into cats, no worries; the cat isn’t pushy and you could probably spend your entire trip ~not~ seeing him if that’s more your style. The off-street parking was clean and safe, something that can be hard to secure in Chicago. The apartment is located very close to both the train and the bus, making in-city traveling quite easy. I would highly recommend this AirBnB!",1.0
Chicago,It’s a wonderful and comfortable place to stay. Kay is really great at communicating with guests and is super nice and welcoming. The space is very clean and has a nice charm to it. We only stayed for one night but I definitely will keep this place in mind if I ever make it up to Chicago again.,1.0
Chicago,I extremely enjoyed my stay at Kay's place.  The location is perfect. My favorite part was having a Target with a Starbucks and market near by. This place is also closely located to a CTA and the freeway entrance if you have a car.  Kay provides many good ameneties and I was very happy for that. She is quickly responsive and super helpful. I'm glad I got to meet her. She is a sweet person.  It is 15 min away from the city.    Also if you have a rental/car there is parking near by!!!  Thanks Kay,1.0
Chicago,"Five stars isn’t enough! Kay made me feel very welcome and comfortable. I felt as if I was staying with family or an old friend, definitely not a stranger. She provided breakfast and coffee for me before I headed out and it definitely gave me a great start. I have a cat at my place, so their friendly lil guy made me feel even more at home. I would definitely recommend her to anyone else and will definitely stay with her again if the opportunity arises.",1.0
Chicago,"I was pleasantly surprised by how amazing the experience turned out to be at Kay's home. The entire house felt inviting and immediately puts you at ease. She puts the guest first and it shows in her thoughtful approach to outfitting the room. From soft bath towels and a loofah at your bedside, to the coffee and tea bar in the kitchen for hot drinks in the morning. She really wants you to feel like you are taken care of the moment you walk in the door. The location is convenient with good selection of restaurants in the area to choose from and downtown is a hop and a skip away for those who want to take in the sights. If it isn't obvious already,  I highly recommend staying with Kay during your trip to Chicago!",1.0
Chicago,"I stayed at Kay's place with two of my friends over St. Pat's weekend. The free parking was a huge blessing, and the apartment was very close to the CTA for local travel. The apartment itself was clean and well-kept. Kay was a wonderful host! From giving us travel recommendations to providing some St. Patrick's day accessories, she made our stay as enjoyable as possible. We also enjoyed helping ourselves to the coffee bar and playing with her adorable cat. All of our expectations for our stay were far exceeded and I would gladly stay here again.",1.0

Her place is so cute and even offers a breakfast bar with coffee, snacks and breakfast foods. She even left a loofa, towels and washcloths for me with chocolates. Also, there were loads of local brochures and magazines to browse. Her 16 year old cat Toby is such a love! He was super friendly and sweet. It was raining on the day I was going out to adventure in the city and I Kay was so cool about lending me her umbrella. She’s a kind soul and was so helpful with local tips for eats and getting around. Highly recommend staying at Kay’s!",1.0
Chicago,"Kay provided a great Airbnb! She was prompt in her responses and provided a few extra touches that made our stay very welcoming (water bottles in the room's mini-fridge, clear and prompt communication, breakfast items (although we skipped out on those), well-labeled instructions outside the door on how to get in as well as within the house to make things very clear, etc.)",1.0
Chicago,"Best Airbnb I've stayed in!

Chicago,Kay is an Amazing host with an air bnb that makes you feel at home! The entire house is sparkling clean and full of creative and cute decor. This room is spacious and fully furnished with all the amenities you may need. The check-in/out is simple with thorough instructions. The el (CTA train) is a short 5min walk in a safe neighborhood. This is the second time I’ve stayed here and both times there were other guests yet it was very quiet and comfortable stay and rest. Respect this space as it truly is a gem!,1.0
Chicago,Great stay. Kay’s place was in a great location close to downtown and public transportation. The room and bathroom were very clean and had nice touches.

Chicago,"Kay's place was really awesome in a good neighborhood, easily accessible from public transport. Very highly recommended, especially for budget travelers like myself.   The apartment and room were cozy and I felt like being at home during my stay, with access to kitchen and living room area. The cat is super friendly too!   Kay as a person was a nice host. She even gave me some medicine upon request, as I was catching some cold from the weather in Chicago.   If I ever come back to Chicago I have a reliable place to stay :)",1.0
Chicago,"Kay is an absolute pro of a host.  She communicated check-in instructions very clearly and regularly  touched-base to make sure I had everything I needed during my stay.  Her place is ideally situated a mere 5 minute walk from an L train station (which is a fantastic way to get around Chicago as I discovered).  Very comfortable, clean, and safe place to spend your nights when visiting Chicago-- can't recommend enough.",1.0
Chicago,"The misfortune of staying at Kay's is that one will quickly realize that not every host will be like her! :-/ I was able to take the train (as she pre-stay suggested) directly out of midway and walk about 2 blocks & if cleanliness is next to godliness, then trust Kay has you covered. And to be completely honest, Kay extended herself to me in an act that goes way beyond the scope of AirBnb. I was comfortable, I felt safe, the room was very dedicated. Being that she was my 1st AirBnb experience,  I really feel like I lucked up. Omg, and her snack bar (fresh yummies), were too delish! :-* #BookHer",1.0
Chicago,"Kay is a fantastic host and I can not recommend her enough. When we contacted her for anything we needed, the response was lightning-fast! She was courteous and made her home warm and inviting for her guests. She really took a burden off our shoulders while planning a last-minute trip to Chicago. If you’re looking for a great experience for a really reasonable price, definitely book with Kay!",1.0
Chicago,"If I could give 6 stars I would. Kay's place was immaculate, cute, comfortable, easy to access — everything you could ask for in an Airbnb. Kay herself is an excellent and hospitable host, helping us out with umbrellas, breakfast, sunscreen, loofas — all the little things that shows she truly cares about making her guests' experience as amazing as possible. She is a gracious and generous person and I would 100% stay at her property again. ",1.0
Chicago,"If you don't like stairs or cats, that is the only reason not to stay here. Location is good, ample parking & light outdoors- ammenities are top & Kay is an awesome host with a BIG heart for her aging cat- that alone should make her 1st choice for any cat lover.",1.0
Chicago,Kay's place was absolutely amazing. She was a perfect host and made my vacation feel so comfortable. I was traveling alone and one late night she even messaged me to make sure I was ok. I think that was such an amazing gesture. The room and apartment was exactly as described and so comfortable. ,1.0

Chicago,This was a truly desperate search for a safe place for my daughter to stay last minute while out of town.  She made last minute plans to travel to Chicago for the Gold Cup soccer match.  Once there she could not find a hotel to rent to her because she is 18.  She was in her car crying.  I booked with Jim on the internet and spoke with him by phone.  He was so great!!!  He met her and her boyfriend at the door.  He even spoke Spanish with her boyfriend which made him feel great.  He assured me by phone about how safe the neighborhood  was and that he would be on the premises just a moments notice away.  He treated them like adults but still helped me feel comfortable about their safety knowing they will always be my babies.  It was truly above and beyond.  And my daughter said the apartment was gorgeous.,1.0

Chicago,Our stay was perfect! Everything was incredibly clean and smelled lovely when we walked in. They responded promptly to any messages I sent. The modern touch to the retro atmosphere made the apartment feel both cozy and familiar. We weren't bothered by any noise in the neighborhood neither during the day nor through the night. That combined with the comfy bed made for a good night's sleep. 10/10 would book again,1.0

Chicago,"This place is lovely. It’s a very clean and well restored apartment.  The windows are about at ground level, so actually the floor of the apartment is 2-3’ below ground level.  We liked this, it felt cozy and being on the ground floor was very convenient. The design of the kitchen and living room is very nice, the bedrooms are comfortable and private. Took a few baths, nice bathroom. It was very quiet, almost no street noise. Just a few blocks from Clark street and a few more to the train. We loved staying here!",1.0

There are plenty of restaurants and bars which you can easily walk to along with some boutique shopping.   You are a quick walk to several CTA bus routes and a longer walk to the red line.

Chicago,"Jim & Maximo’s apartment is beautiful & well located. This was our 3rd visit to Chicago for a girls weekend; first time in Andersonville. Nice quiet neighborhood with Uber/lyft convenience to most city locations in 15-20 min. Apartment is on ground floor, some street noise but overall very quiet. Neighborhood is safe with quick walks to great eating spots. We recommend the little red wolf & mhenry.  Apartment is well furnished with nice appliances & conveniences, great WiFi. Host was attentive, but only needed on day 1: we’re pretty low key. Only recommendation would be additional blankets/ linens for pull out couch in living area.",1.0

I could not have asked for a better experience!",1.0
Chicago,"Our stay in Chicago was great and we really enjoyed staying in Andersonville. It was far enough away to be quiet but only a 12-15 minute walk to the train station, which we didn’t mind at all. The neighborhood felt safe enough to walk in and we liked the local coffee shops and restaurants.   The apartment was nicely decorated and clean. I would just give a heads up that if you’re a light sleeper you can hear the hosts upstairs because it’s an old building. I would never take away a star for this because it’s just a personal thing. My wife is a heavy sleeper and it never bothered her but I had to download a white noise app on my phone to fall asleep.   The hosts were great communicators and asked if we needed anything and how our stay was going. We both enjoyed it and would stay here again!",1.0
Chicago,"Jim's place is just as pictured and described and was a lovely, comfortable, clean and quiet place to stay while I visited family and friends in the Chicago area. The location is halfway between the main city and Evanston, which was perfect for me, and it was very close to some really cool restaurants/bakeries, etc. Had no trouble getting around and found parking on the street each night without trouble. Safe and quiet neighborhood. Jim and Maximo were very attentive and had supplied everything I needed for my stay. Would definitely stay there again.",1.0

Chicago,"Jim's place was FANTASTIC. The place was exactly what we expected it to be from the fabulous photos which were 100% accurate showing off the truly lovely and well decorated apartment. Very clean, well appointed, extra towels and pillows, fantastic magazines for relaxing reading, GREAT map of the local neighborhood in order to find fantastic local shops and places to eat.  You can totally get around on public transit (mostly CTA Bus) from this apartment. Note: the place is a little far from the CTA train stations into downtown. We rented a car and really appreciated the flexibility to get around the city easily and great neighborhood street parking.   The apartment is well appointed with everything you need for your stay. One of the bedrooms is street facing but there is not much traffic so it stayed very quiet at night. Air conditioning for the summer time is a huge plus on muggy hot days!  Andersonville neighborhood is one of my favorite areas of Chicago. It is quaint, full of local  charm, great eats and drinks within walking distance, and a fantastic way to get a feel of what real Chicago is like (and not the fake touristy stuff). Off the beaten path geek thing we did - we drove to and walked through the nearby Rosehill Cemetery Mausoleum. The old original section has a substantial collection of LC Tiffany stained glass windows and walking the completely silent hallways to see the sun shining through these beautiful windows is pretty awesome if you like that sort of thing.  Love Jim's place! Beyond 5 stars! We will hopefully be back to town and rent out his apartment again in the future. ",1.0
Chicago,"Great space to spend a few days. Neighborhood was a few miles north of the downtown area of Chicago. Very quiet but still had the Chicago city feel to it.

I'd recommend it to anyone looking to stay in the area.",1.0
Chicago,"Jim and Maximo were great hosts! This spacious two-bed, one-bath is the perfect getaway for family and friends! I picked Andersonville, because it's a great LGBTQ+ friendly neighborhood and was a great location to experience all of the Pride festivities happening over the weekend during our stay. Jim and Maximo were super responsive and very accommodating throughout my entire experience even before arriving for the weekend! The neighborhood is a family-friendly area and was very walk-able with lots of places to go for food, coffee or to go grocery shopping.

Chicago,"We really enjoyed staying at Jim's place over a quick weekend get-away to Chicago. It's very close to all the Andersonville shops and restaurants on Clark St. and a short walk to the el stop to go downtown; it's in a lovely, quiet, leafy neighborhood of brownstones. Parking was easy -- there was street parking right outside the apartment; we parked the car when we arrived Friday and didn't need to move it or use it until we left on Sunday. The apartment was very clean and well-appointed, with a great kitchen and nice amenities. Jim was there to give us the keys when we checked in; he and Maximo were available if needed but also gave us space. We'd highly recommend this one!",1.0
Chicago,"Stylish apartment in a great location with convenient parking and great restaurants/shops nearby. We really enjoyed our stay here. The kitchen had everything we needed to cook and prepare our own food. Jim was very responsive and accommodating, which made everything easy and enjoyable.

Overall a great space and great experience!",1.0

Chicago,"We loved staying here! The place was beautiful, with many nice touches, a charming older building but remodelled with modern amenities, and sparkling clean. Getting in was very convenient, there were snacks left there for us to enjoy, parking on the street was easy, and Jim and Maximo always responded immediately to all of our queries, plus checked in to see if we wanted coffee, or needed anything else from them, checked on the comfort of the beds, and generally made sure that we had a great stay and felt well cared for. The kitchen is well appointed - the only thing not available was a microwave, but Maximo commented that he's about to get one for the apartment so that can be expected soon.  This is a great apartment with caring and involved hosts. I recommend staying here unconditionally!",1.0
Chicago,"The apartment was beautiful and very spacious. There are restaurants, grocery stores and pharmacies within walking distance. The neighborhood seemed very safe and we enjoyed walking around even in the cold weather. The Keurig and snack basket were nice touches which we appreciated. The beds were  too firm to be comfortable for me, but my boyfriend was fine with it, so it may be personal preference. Jim and Maximo were very attentive and always ready to help. Please note, the apartment does not have a microwave. Also, there is a policy that you cannot have any guest enter into the apartment (not just for sleeping, but for visiting too) which I misunderstood when booking, but it was not a problem since it was only the two of us. If you're traveling in a group or with family staying in other places, you may want to look for another place if you want them to be able to visit you. Overall our stay was lovely and we would recommend this apartment.",1.0

Loved it!",1.0
Chicago,"As a single traveler the studio set up was perfect for me. The location was great, since I had just been staying downtown at a conference prior to my stay it was nice to get out a bit and see some other neighborhoods. I could easily walk to the 606 Trail - which I really enjoyed - and N Milwaukee Ave for some fun shopping. I appreciated the guide they had in the studio with local recommendations listed, I got take-out from the Indian place down the street and it was delicious. Very comfortable bed!",1.0

The little touches, such as welcome beers, pour over coffee, books on Chicago, and available toilet trees (we flew in and only had carry-one) were perfect.

First: it is it's own little building in the city. Wow! It's designed so beautifully, I took tons of photos to inspire my guest house back in CT. Elinor was responsive, accommodating, and super nice. I'm spreading the word to all of my friends who are jazzed staying there. The location is 10-12 minutes from downtown... well worth it for these gorgeous accommodations. BTW: the photos don't really capture the details and inviting sweetness of the place. I'll see you again, Elinor!",1.0
Chicago,"Ellie and Devin's space is charming! It's a well-designed, well-maintained large studio with incredibly thoughtful touches: books about the history of Chicago, more books from Chicago based writers and poets, games, postcards, and even stamps. I was a little nervous the first night with the studio being so close to the street, but I slept like a dream – the bed is comfortable and the studio is airy and bright. The place is exactly as pictured, even better. Ellie and Devin were very responsive and helpful. I would definitely come back and highly recommend staying here.",1.0

It was the perfect space for a quick getaway to Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"Amazing and beautiful first airbnb experience. The place was decorated very modern and was clean. Both the walk in shower and claw-foot tub were great and the water got very hot.

Check in/out is super easy, and the studio manual made our interactions minimal.   Great place to stay, will absolutely repeat.   Thanks again!",1.0
Chicago,"This place was great. It's worth the price just to swim around in that huge bathtub. Ellie was a great host, and the apartment had everything you could need for a great time in Chicago. I found most places I needed to go (food, cute shops, metro) to be about a ~10 min walk away, which I don't mind because I love to walk, but if you don't consider getting a car. It was really easy to get to downtown using the train. I have no complaints, this was an awesome  place!",1.0
Chicago,"This is such a cute, clean and comfortable space! I could stay here for weeks! Nice little neighborhood. Had initially worried about noise at night, but it did quiet down for a restful evening.  The fresh ground coffee, sodas, beer help to make it comfortable. Nice distance from downtown. Safe to run in the mornings with a park nearby. Love this place!",1.0
Chicago,"Ellie’s studio is absolutely stunning! She goes above & beyond for her guest! There are loads of local nicknacks laying around the studio to indulge into. She has her cabinets stocked with things one might need (ibuprofen, cotton swabs, razors, etc). The neighbor hood is very nice. There are not many of taxi’s in the area, so if you don’t drive one might want to download uber. Definitely worth the stay! Would definitely come back!",1.0
Chicago,"Fantastic stay! The studio was as pristine as pictured. You felt more like you were staying in a hotel than someone's home. Great amenities like shampoo, soft towels and even yoga mats! Would highly recommend,",1.0
Chicago,"Elinor's studio was a magical place, and I could tell as I soon as I stepped up to the door, because care was taken in styling the exterior with little faerie lights that sparkled. I hate to say this, but I can be a bit of snob when it comes aesthetic and decor. I have not one complaint about this studio. I was absolutely blown away. The incredible level of detail and design, even down to the studio's handbook was meticulous and thought out.  What's even more wonderful is the central location to all the haunts in the Bucktown/Wicker Park area. I drove and literally everywhere I went was less than a 10 minutes away. I can't imagine that taking public transportation would take any longer. If you do drive, Elinor provides a parking permit, which gives you the freedom to park anywhere in the vivinity without the fear of getting a ticket.  By far Elinor's place is one of the best spots I've stayed in for Air BnB. If you're looking for something magical and romantic (oh, I forgot to mention there's wonderfully restored claw-foot Victorian bath tub) look no further.",1.0
Chicago,Stayed here while visiting Chicago. The apartment was really clean and cozy and located in a really good location for our trip. We were able to park right out front for our stay and walk everywhere. If you're looking to spend time in the Ukrainian Village i would recommend staying here. Close to the train if ya want to travel other places too.,1.0
Chicago,"The initial observation of the space was of course a stylish space for a reasonable price.  Seeing the space in person is such an enjoyable experience - especially when noticing all the fine details not revealed in the online pics.  It is in those details that raises the level of impression and sets it apart from other spaces.    Elinor and I had minimal contact, but that was because instructions were clear on the check-in and check-out procedures, where to park, and even how to make the coffee - which we were thoroughly confused at first.    I enjoy exploring different places to stay when visiting areas, but I would consider staying here again on my next trip to Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"I enjoyed my stay at Elinor's studio apartment in Wicker Park.  The location was pefect for me.  The studio was quite stylish and had many personal touches, including a studio manual which I found quite helpful and fun.  I really appreciated the 2 bottles of wine and the beer selection in the fridge.  The kitchen was minimal but that was fine with me because I planned to enjoy Chicago's dining scene.  The bed was  very confortable, which was a definite plus.  The heater was somewhat louder than I was expecting, but that is the only concern I had.  I would definitely stay here again.",1.0
Chicago,"This is a great spot. Located near hip Wicker Park and related. Quiet, good access to Metro and very pleasant spot to hang out and do some work too. Hostess was very helpful on restaurants etc . This is a top BnB!!!",1.0
Chicago,"The space is exactly as described. Gorgeous. The bathroom is stylish, clean, and the shower is great. Would love to have a space like that in my own home tbh. They have cute touches throughout the studio, including Where Chefs Eat (I have that at home too!) and Studs Terkel's ""Working"" in the bathroom. The bed was really comfortable and once we figured out how to configure the NEST properly for our purposes, the temperature control was on point. One minor note is that both heat and cool air come out predominantly at the head of the bed, and it could be bothersome to people who are sensitive to dry air. My wife had to turn to the foot of the bed one night because she's super sensitive, but it didn't bother me much. The location was good for me because I don't need to be right downtown and don't mind taking a Lyft everywhere, plus I like to be in ""real"" neighborhoods. Puerto Rican restaurants abound as well as cool street art, if you care to venture around. It's about a twenty minute drive to many downtown area attractions. The hosts were very accommodating to my needs, as I had to cancel one day due to a family emergency. They were very easy to work with throughout. Will definitely look to return here my next stay in Chicago",1.0
Chicago,Elinor's place is close to perfect. Every corner of the space is thoughtfully detailed and styled. It's located very centrally to Logan Square and the Bucktown/Wicker Park area and I enjoyed walking the neighborhood in my downtime. Her communication was clear and extremely quick and I truly cannot say enough about how pleasant my stay was. Highly recommended.,1.0
Chicago,"Before I arrived, I loved the photos and thought the place would be perfect for my stay over New Year's. Walking in, it was somehow even better. From the furniture to the lighting to the tableware, everything in the space is very intentionally curated. I have a feeling the owners are designers; the whole place has a great aesthetic while still being comfortable. One of my favorite places I've stayed so far",1.0
Chicago,"We had a great stay at this charming, stylish studio. Clean digs and thoughtful touches like coffee, beer, and wine were lovely. Location was perfect for getting around town by foot or Lyft, yet the street itself was quiet and residential. Great host communication and simple check in and check out. Would stay again in a heartbeat!",1.0
Chicago,"I love this spot . The layout, decor and vibe are definitely hip. Everything is so easy + the communication with Elinor is on point. The amenities are great . The experience is very hommie , every time you discover little details that make a difference in your stay.   If you’re looking for something local, not loud ,  away from tourists this is definitely a good location.",1.0
Chicago,"Ellie’s place is so so wonderful! Chic, stylish, beautiful location from which you can easily access the trendiest Chicago area, Wicker Park. Ellie responds in mere minutes should you need anything and the keypad entry makes it so easy to come and go as you please, no need for keys! 10/10 would recommend and hope to stay here again! ❤️",1.0
Chicago,"Beautiful decor with so much space! Instructions for checkin were easy to follow. The coffee and extras were great!  Very comfortable bed! The apartment has an urban ambiance. Jeremy provided parking passes and we were able to find parking a block away. Communication was excellent. Jeremy answered any questions I had almost immediately. Neighborhood had a safe feel. We walked to local restaurants close by. One unfortunate thing, which was no fault of our host- when we went to leave, we discoveredthat our catalytic converter was stolen off of our car. I had driven our older SUV since I knew it would be parked for several days. Turns out, these are easiervehicles to get under and cut. I would not hesitate to stay here again.",1.0
Chicago,"This Airbnb is the best! Location and space are the key highlights! Jeremy has great design taste! Close to the train and many restaurants. We would definitely stay here again! If you’re visiting, try the rolled ice cream across the street! We had it twice!",1.0
Chicago,"The apartment was absolutely fantastic and everything was as good as advertised. The entire unit was much more spacious than it appeared in the photos which was a welcomed surprise as I have stayed in several Airbnb's that were smaller than photographed.   You could not ask for a better location, one block from the blue line which made traveling to/from O'Hare and into downtown a breeze. You're also within walking distance to countless top notch restaurants and shops.  Jeremy was a very responsive and accommodating host and he really made us feel taken care of when we had some flight plan changes. I would recommend this apartment to anyone wanting to visit Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"There is much to like about this apartment.  It's spacious, has full amenities, plenty of character, parking is included, and the place is clean.  Wicker Park is growing, has a unique vibe, feels safe, and offers options within walking distance for groceries.  The area also has many choices for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and drinks.  We chose to use the kitchen for breakfast, and the waffle maker was a great perk.  A critical factor in comfort, rest and relaxation is the bed.  While clean, we found the mattress to be uncomfortable.  It currently presents itself as firm and lumpy with indentations and sag from years of use.  Upgrading this one very important item would make this location, apartment, and experience worth renting again.  We enjoyed our stay overall and will keep this as an option in the future.",1.0
Chicago,"Came to Chicago for my cousin's birthday party. It was in my old neighborhood, so I felt very much at home. The place was spacious and exactly how it was described! I briefly meet Jeremy when I arrived, he was extremely nice. Would love to come back here when I visit Chicago again.",1.0
Chicago,"I loved this loft and everything about it.  The location was great - 1.5 blocks from the CTA - we were able to explore the entire city using public transportation.  Check in and check out were a breeze.  Jeremy was kind and offered great suggestions when we met briefly during the stay.  The apartment was spotlessly clean, comfortable, quiet and well appointed.  This was my first visit to Chicago and I would gladly stay here on my next trip.",1.0
Chicago,"We loved this place. It's spacious and very convenient. If you have small children, you may want to know that there is a firehouse nearby, but it did not bother us, we expected city noises. There's a Metro station barely a block away. It's great to have a washer and dryer right in the apartment since we tend to pack very lightly. We greatly appreciated the neighborhood parking stickers Jeremey provided and we easily found parking about 1 block away on a safe, residential street. We'll stay here again next time we're in town.",1.0
Chicago,"This is a large, 1 bedroom apartment within 2 blocks of the blue line. Very convenient! There’s a well equipped full kitchen with a small grocery across the street. Of course there a numerous great restaurants in the area so there’s no need to cook. The apartment was very comfortable and clean. We had plenty of pillows, blankets, towels etc. which was much appreciated.",1.0
Chicago,"This was my very first AirBnB and if all of them are like this one, I'll never stay in a hotel again. Jeremey's communication was excellent from start to finish and his home is so beautiful and immaculate. It is easy to find and right off the blue line. The home had EVERYTHING I needed and then some. He even left me 2 day parking passes for the area which made people coming by easy to park nearby. It is in a very cool neighborhood and as a single woman staying in an area I've never been, I felt very safe. When I visit again, I would definitely stay there again.",1.0
Chicago,Jeremey is a wonderful host and his place is extremely nice. He is quick to respond with any questions and is willing to give recommendations around the city. The place was clean and decorated with care. It has everything you would need during your stay.,1.0
Chicago,"Jeremy's apartment is exactly as advertised - stylish, large, comfortable and spotlessly clean in a very safe, hip neighborhood.  The kitchen has all you would need to fix your own meals.  We, however, opted to take advantage of the multitude of excellent bars, coffee shops and restaurants within very easy walking distance on Division Street and North Milwaukee Avenue (for lovers of high quality Nepalese / Indian food we recommend Cumin on North Milwaukee). Communication with Jeremy was very easy.  If and when we return to this part of Chicago Wicker we would, without hesitation choose to stay in Jeremy's place.",1.0
Chicago,"We were very pleased with the apartment. With an updated modern kitchen and bathroom we had everything we needed to be comfortable. Jeremy was a great host, communicated all details we needed when needed.",1.0
Chicago,Jeremy's place was fantastic! It is really big. Was great to unpack and have space and feel at home. Really close to the blue line. Easy to get anywhere. Felt safe in the neighborhood. Fire station next door but never bothered us or woke us up. Would definitely stay again!,1.0
Chicago,Our stay was great! Jeremey was very responsive when we asked him about accommodating our two dogs during the stay. There was even a small crate provided that we ended up using for the smaller pup. Everything was just as described and the apartment is close to many great restaurants and shops. We'd stay again! :),1.0
Chicago,"Jeremey's place is fantastic -- it's bigger than we were expecting and has a really nice overall feel to it.  It's nicely decorated and has all the amenities you would need.  Jeremey was very quick to respond to messages and helped out if anything at all was needed.  Check-in was simple and the building felt secure.  It's just a couple minutes' walk to the blue line, which brings you right into downtown in about 10 minutes.  Also close to some cool spots on N Milwaukee, like Oiistar, the amazing ramen place.  Super nice experience and we'd definitely stay with Jeremey again!",1.0
Chicago,"This was perfect for our needs.  Everything was as advertised.  It's a beautiful space and the location is great.  (Ashland itself is not too appealing but you're a one-minute walk from blue line, can stroll west on Division or walk up Milwaukee Ave to Bucktown.).  Self-checkin was super easy and we had everything we needed.",1.0
Chicago,"Jeremy was very responsive, answering all questions quickly and thoroughly.  His place was nice and very clean.  My parents stayed at the Air BnB to visit me and were quite pleased.  Being that I own and live in downtown Chicago, I can say that this location fantastic and the price to be a great value.",1.0
Chicago,This place is one of the nicest accommodations I have ever stayed at. Yes the price is expensive compared to a hotel but if you want a solid night's sleep and little slice of home be sure to check out Jeremy's place!,1.0
Chicago,Wonderful place.  We really enjoyed ourselves and relaxed at Jeremey's loft.  Very clean.  We enjoyed being able to watch people on the streets from the loft.  Love the mixture of cultures which we don't get much of back home.  Location was great.  Very quick walk to get to Wicker Park and many great local restaurants as well.  Felt very safe in the neighborhood and at Jeremey's place.  Super nice people.  Jeremey is fantastic at returning messages.  Always a quick reply and we had no problems at all that couldn't be fixed quickly.  Highly recommend Jeremey's loft!,1.0
Chicago,"Jeremey's apartment far exceeded our expectations.  The pictures don't do justice to how beautiful, stylish and very spacious this place is, not to mention comfortable and clean.  Everything was simply perfect.  Every possible amenity to make you feel right at home--we wanted for nothing.  Comfortable bed and couches, beautiful, roomy bathroom with large shower and plenty of hot water, fully stocked kitchen, excellent wi-fi and incredibly easy check-in process. We loved the location, merely 2 short blocks (roughly 3 min) walk to the Blue line on the L/ subway.  So easy to get to the main attractions downtown, but also in a great spot to explore the Wicker Park/ West Town neighborhoods and all the great restaurants and shops.  An excellent Airbnb experience--Thank you, Jeremey!!",1.0
Chicago,We found it exactly as advertised—perhaps even better. Super accommodations in a great location. Jeremey was very accessible and promptly responded to our requests and questions. We look forward to staying there again on our next trip to Chicago.,1.0
Chicago,We LOVED the location. The area seemed very safe and was central to the blue line and a Divvy bike station. (Tip: take the blue line to and from O’hare to save a lot of money on transportation) The apartment was very roomy and we enjoyed having access to a kitchen. Something to note is the TV does not have cable or “smart” access. We ended up buying a firestick so we had something to watch while winding down at the end of our days. Jeremy was quick to respond any time we had questions or needed anything! Thank you for a great stay!,1.0
Chicago,"Better than it looked online, a beautiful space with everything needed and then some. Great location, close to public transportation and wonderful local spots. Jeremy was attentive and helpful with all of my queries. Would stay here whenever I’m in Chicago. Can’t recom enough!",1.0
Chicago,"This is a beautiful unit in a great neighborhood in Chicago.  Jeremy was a great host and was easy to communicate with.  Check-in and check-out were a breeze and the apartment was spotless.  It's on a busy street but there was very little noise.  The blue line is a block away as are Target, CVS and a bunch of great coffee shops and places to eat.  Also super easy to pick up a cab or an Uber/Lyft.  Would recommend this place without hesitation!",1.0
Chicago,Communication was fast and easy and Jeremey was available every step of the way.    Apartment was better than I expected.  Great location and very close to the Blue Line which can get you just about anywhere.     Would absolutely recommend and would stay here again in the future.   ,1.0
Chicago,"This is a spacious apartment and very nicely furnished. The location is just a few minutes walk from the blue line with quick transportation direct to the heart of downtown. Check-in was easy and the host provided a sheet with lots of helpful suggestions for local eating places, of which there are many.  Staying at Jeremey's place for 4 nights provided a very comfortable place to stay for our tired bodies after spending our days exploring Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,Jeremey’s place is very spacious and clean.  It has everything you need for a short or long term stay.  Jeremey is very nice and answers any question very promptly.  The location is also very convenient for travel on public transport.  Highly recommended!,1.0
Chicago,"Couldn't have asked for a better place. It was super easy to get to and from both town and O'Hare, with a Blue Line stop only one block away. It was beautiful and cheerful as well. Loved the full kitchen and nice extra-large tub. Jeremey was a lovely host. I wish we could have stayed even longer!",1.0
Chicago,"Great location with convenient transportation. The neighborhood has a cool vibe. As a vinyl record collector, I was excited about being across the street from Dusty Groove and close to Reckless Records. Great overall experience.",1.0
Chicago,"My wife and I spent 2 nights at Jeremey's place. While pictures can often be deceiving, we were pleasantly surprised at how large and open the apartment was in person. It was perfect. Jeremey was traveling in Spain at the time, but he was quick to respond to questions we had the day of and during the trip about things such as checking in and adjusting the nest thermostat. We'd happily stay there again.",1.0
Chicago,Great space in a convenient location—a vibrant neighborhood and just a block from blue line. The apartment has a good vibe and personality and is very clean. Jeremy was attentive and responsive. I’ll go back.,1.0
Chicago,"Jeremey's apartment is really great. It's large and bright in all the right places (and quieter and darker in the bedroom, which is lovely for sleeping), stylishly decorated (without being overdone--the decor fits the urban space perfectly), has a fantastic shower, everything you need for a comfortable stay and is in one of my favorite Chicago neighborhoods, with a bajiggety restaurants, bars, shops, etc. The provided parking passes are super helpful, especially for weekend stays, because parking in this part of the city is no joke (in fact, if you can manage without a car, do, because you won't need it once you're here--everything is walkable, lyft/uber is plentiful and the El train is literally right there.)  If mobility is an issue for you, you should know that you have to walk up a flight of steep, narrow stairs to get to the apartment. Also, it's really in the real city, and real cities generally aren't that quiet, so if you're a super sensitive sleeper who needs deep, dark silence, you'll maybe want to bring ear plugs and/or a sleep mask.   But otherwise, I completely recommend this place. Jeremey is a kind, helpful and responsive host, the apartment is so lovely, and it's a really great value for Chicago, too.",1.0
Chicago,"We enjoyed our stay at Jeremy’s place. It's conveniently located, about 15 minutes to the loop and 20 minutes to Midway airport. Although we got around with Uber, the blue line is just minutes across the street. The apartment is super clean and lovely decorated. Jeremy is very thoughtful with the travel guide and tips. It was great to meet a Cal alumni at Chicago. =) I would recommend this listing to everyone.",1.0
Chicago,"This home was great. Jeremey provided easy check in details and instructions. The location was great because I was close to everything downtown and many shops and stores. I recommend this home and would certainly stay here again. Thanks again, Jeremey!",1.0
Chicago,"Jeremy was easily accessible for any questions via text and he even checked in the second day to make sure everything was okay. The apartment spacious, comfortable and centrally located. Just a few steps to the blue line CTA train, restaurants and shops. The neighborhood is busy so the provided parking permits were a huge plus.",1.0
Chicago,"This space is amazing. Plenty of room, furnishings are great, kitchen has everything you could need, and the shower was perfect after a long day of exploring Chicago in the cold. Jeremey was prompt with responses and great about giving me tips on places to check out. Literally just a few steps away from the Blue Line which made getting around the city super easy. I will definitely be looking to get this place again next time I am in Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"Great place! We stayed there with our 18month during our summer holiday trip, all three of us loved Jeremey’s place. Bigger than expected. Jeremey was very supportive and fast with all kind of questions. We can highly recommend this place, also when you are traveling with small children.",1.0
Chicago,"What a great stay in Chicago!!! Jeremey‘s loft is perfectly situated in one of our favourite areas within Chicago. There are so many things to explore in walking distance: restaurants, shopping, parks, and the great 606 trail. The train („L“, blue line) - which is more or less directly in front of the apartment - connects you directly with downtown as well as with the airport. The apartment is so cool, we would love to live there! Despite the busy street in front of the house the apartments inside is so quiet and we slept like babies. Jeremey is a fantastic host and helped us a lot to find our ways, gave us great recommendations and answered immediately whenever we wrote a message. We will definitely come again!!!",1.0
Chicago,"A very spacious and spotlessly clean apartment, it holds special charm with bare brick walls and wooden floors with plenty of seating and a very large bed with a well equipped dressing room.  The bathroom is great with a very impressive bath for easing away the muscles after a long day of exploring.  We didn’t use the kitchen much apart from making a hot drink as we ate out most of the time but there is a great health food shop just opposite and a food shop just by the subway station.  Although we didn’t get to meet Jeremey his communication with us was superb.",1.0
Chicago,"Jeremy’s place is amazing, not only is it huge, it has everything you need for a comfortable stay, it’s in a great location for getting around town (literally one minute walk from the blue line at Division), and really easy to get to on the blue line from O’hare airport.  Jeremy was a fantastic host, very quick to respond to any queries we had, and was kind enough to let us leave our bags for a couple of hours while we went for brunch before heading back to the airport.  I would highly recommend his apartment to anyone wanting to explore Chicago.",1.0

Chicago,Beautiful apartment thats is decorated to perfection. Its conveniently located (10 min walk to wicker park and 20 min subway to downtown). Jeremy was very accommodating and his local coffee & donut tips were great!,1.0
Chicago,"Rob’s place was beautiful! It looked exactly as advertised. The apartment was spacious & stylishly decorated. Lots of restaurants & bars within walking distance, as well as a grocery store. Rob was super responsive & hospitable. We were not able to check in before 3, but he allowed us to leave our luggage in his store prior to check in & even took it upstairs to the apartment for us! The only downside was that the bedroom can get a little warm, especially on a hot summer day. Other than that, we fully enjoyed our stay. Would definitely stay here again!",1.0
Chicago,"Rob’s Place was beautifully furnished and decorated. It was also only a 3 minute walk from the nearest bus stop which can take you to downtown or any of the metro/L lines - very convenient. The only downside is that there is no air conditioning in the bedroom so it got really hot. It is also on the 3rd floor so that’s something to consider if you don’t like taking the stairs. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and would recommend it!",1.0
Chicago,Rob's place is immaculate! I have never seen an Airbnb so tastefully decorated and cozy. Its in the middle of a bustling restaurant and shopping district but is surprisingly quiet. Rob himself was very responsive and a great host. I would definitely come back here for sure. Make sure you take advantage of the $20/day parking that Rob offers. It was a lifesaver.,1.0
Chicago,"My experience could not have been better. This was the mog immaculate, stylish, modern, and comfortable AirBnB experience I've ever had. The owner has spared no expense, from stainless steel alliances to remodeled bathrooms and showers, to new wood flooring. The temper-pedic bed was heavenly, and the furnishings were modern and comfortable. The attention to detail was unparalleled, from train maps and restaurant guides to Chicago artwork and plenty of cooking utensils and supplies, as well as beauty and hygiene products. I was beyond impressed with the level of care and consideration.   When I return to Chicago in the future, this will be my first choice. Always.",1.0
Chicago,We were In Chicago to see Hamilton and sightsee with our teenaged daughter. We loved this location and neighborhood. It felt safe and there were tons of nearby places to eat or get groceries. The condo itself was extremely clean and was well stocked with necessities. It was spacious and we never felt crowded. Rob was a great host and was very responsive to our questions. It was a plus to have  parking available as we never moved our car until we left Chicago. I would definitely rent from Rob again,1.0
Chicago,"Rob's place is incredibly stylish, supremely located, and overall provides a comfortable, beautiful perch from which to explore the city of Chicago.

Chicago,"This place is a fantastic stay!  Everything is wonderfully decorated, well thought-out, very clean, and it has an authenticity you can only find in a beautiful historic building.  The location is great as well. It’s a 13 minute drive to downtown Chicago, and 500 feet from the best breakfast place in town “Whisk”. You must go there!  Only thing missing in the Airbnb was coffee, so you may want to bring your own. But they have multiple ways to make it if you do.  Great stay, highly recommend this Airbnb!",1.0
Chicago,My wife and I came in to Chicago for our wedding anniversary and are so glad we chose to stay with Rob.  Probably the best Airbnb experience we’ve had.  He really thinks of everything and we can’t recommend staying here enough.,1.0
Chicago,Rob’ s space is 5 stars & beyond. He has gone the extra steps to make his guests well informed about the neighborhood & totally took care of everything you need to be comfortable away from your home. This Airbnb is the cleanest place we have ever stayed in.!!! You feel like you are his VERY FIRST guests! The photos give you a glimpse of the home but it out shines even those. Very modern & well appointed decor. His Christmas decorations were beautiful. He is warm & personable & communcation is outstanding. You will not be disappointed in your stay at Rob’s home!!!!,1.0
Chicago,"By far-this Rob's place is the most STUNNING home my husband and I stayed in. The décor is stylish, modern and pure class. The Holiday decorations made it festive and cozy. I really want those flocked trees!! LOL Absolutely gorgeous. The pictures of this listing does it NO JUSTICE!! Rob is a delight and one of thee most gracious hosts I have encountered. His level of hospitality is unparalleled and he gave us some great suggestions of local eateries in the area. His home is in great proximity to downtown and other neighborhoods. We truly could not be more pleased and dreaded leaving to return back to our home state. However, we will certainly be back and definitely in the process of making plans to book Rob's home again. You will not be disappointed!! Truly his home is a GEM!!!",1.0
Chicago,"The warmest home we've ever been in. Sparkling clean, modern and superb interior design, great location and a very lovely, warm host. Thank you, Rob and we promise to only stay at your place whenever we're in Chicago! An experience to remember!",1.0
Chicago,"This was the cleanest Airbnb we’ve ever stayed in. If you are picky with finding a clean place that actually FEELS clean, this home is for you. You can immediately tell that Rob takes pride in his apartment and everything is so well maintained and stylishly decorated. The bed was a welcomed place for rest after a long day, and we loved how firm the mattress was and how fluffy the pillows were—very comfortable.  The amenities were spot on, the coffeemaker, the gas stove, plenty of dishes and quality cookware to use for making a meal. Not mention, the exceptional decor of the entire apartment! The location was excellent and walkable to numerous local restaurants and bars (a few were literally steps from the apartment door). We loved being on the third floor and always felt super safe. There is some traffic noise that can be heard in the bedroom, but Rob provides earplugs for light sleepers. In truth, we actually enjoyed being lulled to sleep by the sounds of the city and it didn’t bother us at all. The convenience of the grocery store being a 5 minute walk away made buying some pantry and fridge essentials easy. The couch in the living room was super comfy and perfect for relaxing and watching the Thanksgiving Day parade and some Netflix Christmas movies. This was the perfect Airbnb and we were highly impressed (not always easy). 5 stars to Rob for such an amazingly clean, comfortable, stylish, and well thought out home away from home. We’ll be back soon!",1.0
Chicago,"This place is so much nicer in person! And wow the bed was so comfortable we ended up sleeping the first night we got there instead of going out because we got trapped in the bed lol. Communicating with Rob was very easy and his home was supplied with everything!! First aid kit, make up remover wipes you name it lol. The home is in a very quiet and safe neighborhood. Would definitely stay again, one of the nicest places I have ever stayed!",1.0
Chicago,"We had a short but wonderful stay at Rob's place for a weekend trip to Chicago. Communication and check-in were quick and easy, and it was a breeze to get there from the airport on the train and a bus.  The space was spotlessly clean and beautifully furnished, with thoughtful touches that made our stay really comfortable. The location is great too, with a grocery store nearby and lots of good food/drink options as well.  Our only regrets are that we didn't stay here longer to enjoy it more and that we had to catch a Sunday morning flight before we could peruse the beautiful store downstairs some more. We would definitely stay here again, and will happily recommend it to any family and friends who may be looking for a place to stay in Chicago.",1.0

Chicago,"This might be my favorite Airbnb stay to date. The apartment so stunning, clean, and comfortable and charming Ukrainian Village with so much to offer, we chose to make fewer trips into the heart of the city to spend more time enjoying and exploring the immediate surroundings both in and out of the apartment. Yoga, restaurants, shops, grocery...everything within walking distance and this little oasis to temporarily call home. Rob couldn’t have been a better host. Will be back for sure!",1.0
Chicago,Rob’s place was amazing. Right in the center of everything. The location was close to many restaurants and bars. It is also a short ride to surrounding neighborhoods and downtown. The place itself was amazing with all the amenities needed for a great stay. Rob was prompt in his communication and was right below if needed. The parking space was a bonus as it is hard to find parking in this neighborhood without a permit.,1.0
Chicago,"Location, atmosphere, beautiful decor, every thought to amenities (even a First Aid Kit!)... you simply can't go wrong with this great condo in Ukrainian Village.  It was a snowy weekend so we especially enjoyed the cabinet full of games!  We were visiting family in Streeterville and getting there was no problem at all.  Rob greeted us when I arrived, and check-out was very simple.  Also, my brother drove over from a neighboring city to meet me, so we appreciated the off-street parking for him and his daughter.  Stay with Rob!  You won't regret it.",1.0

Extremely clean. Special touches such as video games and snacks. Went above and beyond to provide a welcoming and safe environment. Room was stylized, modern. Plenty of amenities, even access to laundry. If we make our way back to town, we’ll stay here again. Thank you for making our first AirBNB memorable!",1.0
Chicago,"Great place to stay! Very clean and convenient to food and shops! Reminded me of being Ina little apartment. The shower was a bit small, so if you're a larger person it may be difficult to fit. But it was a very nice place and the host were quick to respond.",1.0

The decor is fantastic and we loved many of the little touches including the board games, tasteful art, game systems, and the water and drinks in the fridge were a welcome surprise after our evening arrival. Having central heat as well as a space heater in the unit helped make sure we stayed nice and toasty during our visit. We didn't take advantage of them, but the fact that a washer and dryer were available was a nice bonus.   We'll definitely look here first on our next trip to Chicago!",1.0

Chicago,"What a gem! Christopher’s place was exactly as described including a ton of extras. Christopher was quick to respond before and during my stay. He left a light on for me the night I arrived since I had a super late flight. He even checked in on me the next day to make sure I had everything I needed. The place was totally spotless. The bed was very comfy and there were tons of extra pillows. The kitchen was fully equipped and he even stocked it with several quick food items. These were much appreciated especially the first morning. The space felt so much more roomy than I was expecting. Ceilings are a bit lower being a garden unit but I had no problem at all with it. The water pressure in the shower was really great. Christopher made a really detailed welcome guide with lots of great info abt the neighborhood. The studio is only 3 short blocks away from a bus that takes you directly to the belmont el station (abt a 20-30 min ride). I felt very safe in the neighborhood (family vibe) even when coming in using transit late at night by myself. If you are wanting to do a lot of things in the Loop, transit took me 45-hour sometimes depending on the time of day. This was not a big deal for me bc I wanted a neighborhood experience vs more of a downtown touristy one, but it did take longer to get to and from. Lastly, Christopher was kind enough to  hold my luggage for me on my last day since I had a later flight. All in all, fantastic experience and I highly recommend this listing. Thank you so much, Christopher!",1.0

Chicago,This is such a great place to stay! Awesome location between the airport and downtown. Uber’s were always there within 5 minutes and were reasonably priced for a ride to anywhere in the city.

Transportation was nearby and made our rides to the city very convinient, also we got to explore more of it by using transportation.

The water in the fridge was appreciated! We only stayed one night, but this place has everything you'd need for an extended stay. ",1.0
Chicago,Chris was an amazing host.  His place was very clean and better than we expected.  This was the wife’s first time visiting Chicago and she wasn’t disappointed as this place offers a lot of space for two guests.  Parking on the same street was hit and miss but that can be expected for a big city.  We took Lyft anytime we were visiting downtown Chicago.  It was nice to come and go as we pleased.  Chris responded very quickly to any messages that were sent.  I felt safe enough walking in the general neighborhood.  When we visit Chicago again this would definitely be the first choice.  Our first host cancelled which brought us to finding this gem.,1.0

Chicago,"Samantha & Jonathan's loft was exactly as pictured, and located in a convenient location. I loved the apartment - I would love to live here myself! The stairs to the loft was quite steep as others describe, and I left my suitcase downstairs and only went upstairs to sleep. The bed was very comfortable. My friend whom I stayed with wanted an easy access to the bathroom during night, so she decided to use the air mattress downstairs, which we found in the closet (we moved furnitures around to make space). The walk to the California CTA station was 15-20 min for me, but since it was quite a cold week, I often opted for Uber. As we had packed plans in downtown, we did not get to explore much of the neighborhood nor get to ask for neighborhood tips that Samantha was happy to share, but I'd love to come back to this loft and explore more!",1.0
Chicago,"The loft is located in a great quiet spot that is walking distance from great restaurants and bars. It was a ~15 minute walk from both the Logan Square and California blue line stops, and extremely close to tons and tons of good restaurants and bars (check out Lula, Giant, and Longman & Eagle). Samantha was a great host and the place was spotless when we arrived, with tea and some nice snacks sitting on the table. Checking in and out was as easy and quick as it gets, and we appreciated Samantha periodically messaging us to check on our experience. We would stay here again in a heartbeat. Our only warning is that all the stairs in the building are extremely steep and narrow. We didn't have any problems, but you should be careful. Overall a 5/5 experience.",1.0
Chicago,"The space is exactly as pictured.  Simple, basic, perfect for one or two people.  The bed in the loft was comfortable and the HDTV had plenty of premium channels.  The neighborhood is quiet and we felt safe.  Parking on the street wasn't an issue for us, but it did seem to be full in the evening.  Major bus line is 3 blocks away that will take you straight to the northside Fullerton train stops and the Blue Line station that goes to the loop is about 8 blocks away.  The host is easily reached and communication was great.  Thanks!",1.0
Chicago,"I enjoyed my stay in this space! The studio itself was very clean and quiet during sleeping hours. The staircase to the bed was a little steeper than I had expected, but it was sturdy and I got used to it. It was in a lovely location that had access to buses and trains. I did do a bit of walking, but that was my choice. Samantha and Jonathan were quick with communication and gave suggestions for the area. I would stay again. Thanks!",1.0
Chicago,"Great location (walking distance from Logan Square), safe and quiet neighborhood, and a beautiful, clean, well-stocked space. Also, the design of the apartment is ingenious and full of delights. You have to check it out. We really loved staying here.",1.0
Chicago,"Samantha’s place is fantastic!  As a host, she was so available and communicative.  She offered great neighborhood recommendations.  The place is super clean, hip, and we loved the loft!  I’d recommend this spot to anyone!  It’s great!",1.0
Chicago,The loft was perfect. Exactly as shown in the pictures. Check in and out were super easy. Samantha is an excellent host and she makes things really easy. Location was good and it really made our stay in Chicago an excellent experience. We would definitely come back,1.0
Chicago,"My partner and I loved our stay in this brightly lit and trendy loft! It was exactly as pictured in photos but had great extra touches – hair straightener, iron, coffee, maps etc. Check in and check out were seamless and communication was fast and friendly. We would definitely stay here again. Thank you!",1.0
Chicago,"Samantha's place is absolutely marvelous! It's located in a nice residential area, with some fun bars and restaurants in the neighborhood. If you don't want to wait for a bus, it's a bit of a walk to the blue line, but nothing bad. Uber rides into the city were not that expensive and an easy way to get into the city. The apartment itself is really, really nice. Clean, spacious and an extremely comfy bed. I would highly recommend it to anybody!",1.0
Chicago,A very stylish flat with lots of complimentary toiletries and helpful guide books for the area. The flat isn’t in the city centre but taking an Uber carpool is a cheap and easy way of getting into the main part.,1.0
Chicago,This is a beautifully-designed loft apartment in an upmarket part of town.  It is sparkling clean and has some nice touches such as local coffee. Communication with Samantha was very smooth and she answered our questions quickly.  I would highly recommend staying here in Chicago.,1.0
Chicago,"Lovely apartment in a great area of the city.  Local amenities were perfect (I'd recommend Tony's for any grocery requirement and Wyler Road for a chilled drink and a bit to eat!) and not too far from the ""L"" to the Loop where it's a 20 min ride in.   Hosts were great and very responsive to any request and requirement we had and helped out as much as possible.  The stairs up to the mezzanine are definitely steep but we expected this from the description so not a problem at all and the apartment is carefully thought out to give maximum usability of the space.  Overall a fantastic expperience of this amazing city.",1.0
Chicago,"Place was amazing! My boyfriend and I absolutely loved our stay here in this loft. Area is very clean and very stylish. All of our questions were answered very fast and accurately. Everything was supplied for us, they even had Q-tips lol. ",1.0
Chicago,"We had an amazing stay at Samantha's place. It is located in a quiet neighborhood within 20min walking distance from the blue line. The apartment is spacious and has everything you need including cooking facilities, big comfortable bed, tv etc. We were a bit delayed and arrived late in the evening, but Samantha was extremely kind by helping us ordering pizza while we were absolutely wrecked from traveling. Furthermore, she always responded very quickly to questions from us. We ran in to her husband Jonathan a couple of times who was also super friendly and gave us a ton of advice on what to do in the city. Overall we had a great couple of days in Chicago and we definitely recommend this place! ",1.0
Chicago,"Samantha's place was perfect for our weekend getaway. Travel around the city was very convenient with transit and biking options very closeby. The space was extremely tidy and comfortable, and our hosts were very accommodating...thanks for a wonderful Chicago experience!",1.0
Chicago,"This apartment is great! The apartment itself is already beautiful and special with its high ceilings, and the location is also very nice. In walking distance from Logan square, with nice coffee bars, restaurants, shops and street art. But also in walking distance from public transport that takes you to downtown in just a few stops. We would definitely recommend this place for a great visit to this great city",1.0
Chicago,"Lovely loft studio, spotlessly clean and very well designed with everything we needed. Location is good with the metro about 15 mins walk away then 20 mins to downtown, and a Chicago bike scheme station 5mins away and an even quicker cycle to downtown. We also enjoyed the 606 trail, Chicago's answer to the Highline which is also close by.  So a great place and a great location.",1.0
Chicago,Beautiful apartment in quite neighborhood. The space is great it's location relative to public transit is awesome. Samantha was quick to respond to any questions. I will definitely be checking availability next time I'm back in Chicago.,1.0
Chicago,"We had a great stay at Logan Square. The appartment was spacious (more so than we expected) and very clean with thoughtful provisions provided.   Samantha and Jonathon provided us with a great list of nearby places do eat and drink (from fresh coffee to pizza) and were very helpful in communicating when we asked for help.   Logan Sqaure itself is a lovely leafy neighbourhood around half an hr from Downtown on the train. There's plenty of amenities a short walk from the appartment, as well as loads of great bars. A taxi into Downtown is quicker but more expensive.   The 'L' (elevated train) is a 15-20 min walk from the appt and then a further 15 min or so ride into downtown where there is plenty to do. A weekly ticket for the train is around $30 and gives you access to trains and buses. Very handy for getting around as the bus and L system is easy to use.  On a clear day, we would recommend hiring a bike and taking the Lake Shore route which runs alongside Lake Michigan. You get stunning views of the iconic skyscrapers from across the water.  Hancock Tower on a clear day is also a must see too, with great views for miles.  If the weather is cooler, then there are loads of great museums to visit. the History of Chicago by Lincoln Park is great. The Old Town is nearby for a drink afterwards too.  Definitely a great city to visit with lots to do, and a great appartment in a great neighbourhood. 10/10  Thanks",1.0
Chicago,"The apartment was lovely, clean, and the coffee/snacks were appreciated. The security within the apartment was great, and although the surrounding area was less confidence-inspiring, she had us send a photo of our car once we arrived, and the area had cameras, so it put me at ease. We were super close to both bus and train options that we utilized several times, and within walking distance of target for quick pick-ups. We enjoyed our stay!",1.0
Chicago,"Kay is the best superhost you will ever have!! She is great with communication and is very welcoming! Her apartment has a home-like feeling that will make your vacation even better. Cleanest place ever!! Absolutely spotless and smells amazing!!  If you are looking for suggestions of where to eat and shop, Kay will give you a list of her favorite places and provides a variety brochures, pamphlets, flyers, and food menu’s! I had mentioned my family was vegan and she gave me options of food choices around the area!  Great location!!! I highly recommend staying at Kay’s place if you are visiting Chicago!!",1.0
Chicago,"Kay’s place was very cute and clean!! She was super quick to respond to anything. The train is a quick walk from the apartment though I don’t think I would personally feel safe walking from the train tooo late at night as a young lady. Loved how she  had treats available like bananas, it’s, orange juice, coffee. It is very convenient for a quick trip to downtown Chicago!",1.0
Chicago,"Even though Kay's place was more on the south side of Chicago and I was going to the north side for a Cubs game, her place was great for a one-night stay with how reasonably priced it was right before Memorial Day weekend. I just got ubers to get to and from the game rather than public transit. Kay's place was very comfortable and she was a great host!",1.0
Chicago,"Kay’s place was amazing! Such thoughtful, kind touches, and Kay is super communicative. Seriously, this room was nicer and more well-equipped than some of the luxury hotel’s I’ve stayed at. 100% would stay here again!",1.0
Chicago,"From the extreme cleanliness of the apartment to the added extras everywhere you turn, this place was absolutely perfect! The host is respectful and generous with the most friendly senior kitty ever! Coming “home” to a snuggly feline in the living room was probably the best thing ever (I’m an extreme cat person). However, if you’re not into cats, no worries; the cat isn’t pushy and you could probably spend your entire trip ~not~ seeing him if that’s more your style. The off-street parking was clean and safe, something that can be hard to secure in Chicago. The apartment is located very close to both the train and the bus, making in-city traveling quite easy. I would highly recommend this AirBnB!",1.0
Chicago,It’s a wonderful and comfortable place to stay. Kay is really great at communicating with guests and is super nice and welcoming. The space is very clean and has a nice charm to it. We only stayed for one night but I definitely will keep this place in mind if I ever make it up to Chicago again.,1.0
Chicago,I extremely enjoyed my stay at Kay's place.  The location is perfect. My favorite part was having a Target with a Starbucks and market near by. This place is also closely located to a CTA and the freeway entrance if you have a car.  Kay provides many good ameneties and I was very happy for that. She is quickly responsive and super helpful. I'm glad I got to meet her. She is a sweet person.  It is 15 min away from the city.    Also if you have a rental/car there is parking near by!!!  Thanks Kay,1.0
Chicago,"Five stars isn’t enough! Kay made me feel very welcome and comfortable. I felt as if I was staying with family or an old friend, definitely not a stranger. She provided breakfast and coffee for me before I headed out and it definitely gave me a great start. I have a cat at my place, so their friendly lil guy made me feel even more at home. I would definitely recommend her to anyone else and will definitely stay with her again if the opportunity arises.",1.0
Chicago,"I was pleasantly surprised by how amazing the experience turned out to be at Kay's home. The entire house felt inviting and immediately puts you at ease. She puts the guest first and it shows in her thoughtful approach to outfitting the room. From soft bath towels and a loofah at your bedside, to the coffee and tea bar in the kitchen for hot drinks in the morning. She really wants you to feel like you are taken care of the moment you walk in the door. The location is convenient with good selection of restaurants in the area to choose from and downtown is a hop and a skip away for those who want to take in the sights. If it isn't obvious already,  I highly recommend staying with Kay during your trip to Chicago!",1.0
Chicago,"I stayed at Kay's place with two of my friends over St. Pat's weekend. The free parking was a huge blessing, and the apartment was very close to the CTA for local travel. The apartment itself was clean and well-kept. Kay was a wonderful host! From giving us travel recommendations to providing some St. Patrick's day accessories, she made our stay as enjoyable as possible. We also enjoyed helping ourselves to the coffee bar and playing with her adorable cat. All of our expectations for our stay were far exceeded and I would gladly stay here again.",1.0

Chicago,"Kay was a perfect host. She went out of her way to make sure I was comfortable and ensured I had everything I needed. Her place is so cute and even offers a breakfast bar with coffee, snacks and breakfast foods. She even left a loofa, towels and washcloths for me with chocolates. Also, there were loads of local brochures and magazines to browse. Her 16 year old cat Toby is such a love! He was super friendly and sweet. It was raining on the day I was going out to adventure in the city and I Kay was so cool about lending me her umbrella. She’s a kind soul and was so helpful with local tips for eats and getting around. Highly recommend staying at Kay’s!",1.0
Chicago,"Kay provided a great Airbnb! She was prompt in her responses and provided a few extra touches that made our stay very welcoming (water bottles in the room's mini-fridge, clear and prompt communication, breakfast items (although we skipped out on those), well-labeled instructions outside the door on how to get in as well as within the house to make things very clear, etc.)",1.0
Chicago,"Best Airbnb I've stayed in! Clean, safe, great communication, fantastic amenities, nice and modern/cozy/stylish vibe, easy check in and out, great location: basically this Airbnb had it all and then some! Kay was also super nice and accommodating. I would definitely stay here again and recommend to others!",1.0
Chicago,"Kay's place was perfect for me- free parking in a lot, close to the metro, and south (the direction I was coming from).  Kay is friendly, and her place is clean.  I'll definitely see if Kay's place is available the next time I  visit Chicago!",1.0
Chicago,Kay is an Amazing host with an air bnb that makes you feel at home! The entire house is sparkling clean and full of creative and cute decor. This room is spacious and fully furnished with all the amenities you may need. The check-in/out is simple with thorough instructions. The el (CTA train) is a short 5min walk in a safe neighborhood. This is the second time I’ve stayed here and both times there were other guests yet it was very quiet and comfortable stay and rest. Respect this space as it truly is a gem!,1.0
Chicago,Great stay. Kay’s place was in a great location close to downtown and public transportation. The room and bathroom were very clean and had nice touches. Didn’t meet Kay until the last night (my schedule) but she was very nice and personable. If definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone!! Thank you Kay,1.0

Chicago,"Kay's place was really awesome in a good neighborhood, easily accessible from public transport. Very highly recommended, especially for budget travelers like myself.   The apartment and room were cozy and I felt like being at home during my stay, with access to kitchen and living room area. The cat is super friendly too!   Kay as a person was a nice host. She even gave me some medicine upon request, as I was catching some cold from the weather in Chicago.   If I ever come back to Chicago I have a reliable place to stay :)",1.0
Chicago,"Kay is an absolute pro of a host.  She communicated check-in instructions very clearly and regularly  touched-base to make sure I had everything I needed during my stay.  Her place is ideally situated a mere 5 minute walk from an L train station (which is a fantastic way to get around Chicago as I discovered).  Very comfortable, clean, and safe place to spend your nights when visiting Chicago-- can't recommend enough.",1.0
Chicago,"The misfortune of staying at Kay's is that one will quickly realize that not every host will be like her! :-/ I was able to take the train (as she pre-stay suggested) directly out of midway and walk about 2 blocks & if cleanliness is next to godliness, then trust Kay has you covered. And to be completely honest, Kay extended herself to me in an act that goes way beyond the scope of AirBnb. I was comfortable, I felt safe, the room was very dedicated. Being that she was my 1st AirBnb experience,  I really feel like I lucked up. Omg, and her snack bar (fresh yummies), were too delish! :-* #BookHer",1.0
Chicago,"Kay is a fantastic host and I can not recommend her enough. When we contacted her for anything we needed, the response was lightning-fast! She was courteous and made her home warm and inviting for her guests. She really took a burden off our shoulders while planning a last-minute trip to Chicago. If you’re looking for a great experience for a really reasonable price, definitely book with Kay!",1.0
Chicago,"If I could give 6 stars I would. Kay's place was immaculate, cute, comfortable, easy to access — everything you could ask for in an Airbnb. Kay herself is an excellent and hospitable host, helping us out with umbrellas, breakfast, sunscreen, loofas — all the little things that shows she truly cares about making her guests' experience as amazing as possible. She is a gracious and generous person and I would 100% stay at her property again. ",1.0
Chicago,"If you don't like stairs or cats, that is the only reason not to stay here. Location is good, ample parking & light outdoors- ammenities are top & Kay is an awesome host with a BIG heart for her aging cat- that alone should make her 1st choice for any cat lover.",1.0
Chicago,Kay's place was absolutely amazing. She was a perfect host and made my vacation feel so comfortable. I was traveling alone and one late night she even messaged me to make sure I was ok.

Chicago,"Nice private room, with a firm/squeaky bed. (Just like the description!) beautiful house, in a nice neighbourhood. Gin and Michael offered us coffee and homemade muffins in the morning! It was quite warm when we were there and the AC in the room was great. Meatball is the cutest (loudest) house greeter ever, we love him! He is very enthusiastic for cuddles, and so sweet! Quick and easy access to downtown, via or the pubs/restaurants of the area via train, or bus. Nice map of the neighbourhood in the room. There is so much to see and do in Chicago, stay a while! We have to come back and explore some more, and we would definitely stay at Gin’s again! :) Thanks again!",1.0

Speaking of safe, this neighborhood is perfect for walking around and going for jogs. The boutiques are adorable and the food is outstanding!!! Not to mention, it’s like a 2 block walk to all of these spots!   We recommend Paulie Gee’s square pizza. It’s a beautiful creation. Navigator Taproom has plenty of options and a full bar. It’s real fun to pour your own drinks! Breakfast at Cozy Corner is a must!  Moral of the story, stay here. You can thank me later!",1.0

We felt right at home. My colleagues and I kept looking around saying, ""I love this place. I don't want to leave"". On more than one night, we decided to stay in (rather than go out) just so we could enjoy the fire, movie, selection, and some homemade pasta! I will definiltey be recommending this to anyone and everyone who plans to visit Chicago. BONUS: Just down the street from the best diner/vegan food in the world.",1.0

As it was February in Chicago, we loved the fireplace to keep the space nice and warm. The flat was very clean, and stocked with towels and products for the shower. Danielle gave us a mega list of recommendations ahead of time, which was super helpful and full of cool restaurants and bars. The apartment is in Logan Square, and while we spent a good deal of time there and in places like Wicker Park, the freezing weather had us in lots of Uber’s downtown as well — just something to keep in mind. Though, it’s also off a subway line. Overall, no complaints, and Danielle’s communication was amazing. Would definitely recommend.",1.0
Chicago,I love love love Danielle's place.  It's extremely charming and well decorated. You can definitely tell she put a lot of effort into all the details of the apartment.

If you want explore the Logan Square neighborhood or just want a nice place with easy access to downtown, I’d definitely recommend staying here.",1.0
Chicago,"This has got to be in the top two best airbnb experiences I've had. Danielle's place is so cozy and looks amazing. We ended up spending a lazy Sunday lounging inside by the fireplace and watching dumb movies - an ideal way to spend a day after heavy touristing Friday and Saturday. She was incredibly accommodating throughout our stay with complications our party had with check in and check out. The surrounding area had an incredible pizza place, a bar where we got boozy ice cream floats, some breweries, and way more that we didn't have time to discover because we didn't want to leave the fire. Will 100% look to stay here again in the future!",1.0

Chicago,This was a truly desperate search for a safe place for my daughter to stay last minute while out of town.  She made last minute plans to travel to Chicago for the Gold Cup soccer match.  Once there she could not find a hotel to rent to her because she is 18.  She was in her car crying.  I booked with Jim on the internet and spoke with him by phone.  He was so great!!!  He met her and her boyfriend at the door.  He even spoke Spanish with her boyfriend which made him feel great.  He assured me by phone about how safe the neighborhood  was and that he would be on the premises just a moments notice away.  He treated them like adults but still helped me feel comfortable about their safety knowing they will always be my babies.  It was truly above and beyond.  And my daughter said the apartment was gorgeous.,1.0

Nice quiet neighborhood with Uber/lyft convenience to most city locations in 15-20 min. Apartment is on ground floor, some street noise but overall very quiet. Neighborhood is safe with quick walks to great eating spots. We recommend the little red wolf & mhenry.  Apartment is well furnished with nice appliances & conveniences, great WiFi. Host was attentive, but only needed on day 1: we’re pretty low key. Only recommendation would be additional blankets/ linens for pull out couch in living area.",1.0

Chicago,"Our stay in Chicago was great and we really enjoyed staying in Andersonville. It was far enough away to be quiet but only a 12-15 minute walk to the train station, which we didn’t mind at all. The neighborhood felt safe enough to walk in and we liked the local coffee shops and restaurants.   The apartment was nicely decorated and clean. I would just give a heads up that if you’re a light sleeper you can hear the hosts upstairs because it’s an old building. I would never take away a star for this because it’s just a personal thing. My wife is a heavy sleeper and it never bothered her but I had to download a white noise app on my phone to fall asleep.   The hosts were great communicators and asked if we needed anything and how our stay was going. We both enjoyed it and would stay here again!",1.0

Chicago,"Jim's place was FANTASTIC. The place was exactly what we expected it to be from the fabulous photos which were 100% accurate showing off the truly lovely and well decorated apartment. Very clean, well appointed, extra towels and pillows, fantastic magazines for relaxing reading, GREAT map of the local neighborhood in order to find fantastic local shops and places to eat.  You can totally get around on public transit (mostly CTA Bus) from this apartment. Note: the place is a little far from the CTA train stations into downtown. We rented a car and really appreciated the flexibility to get around the city easily and great neighborhood street parking.   The apartment is well appointed with everything you need for your stay. One of the bedrooms is street facing but there is not much traffic so it stayed very quiet at night. Air conditioning for the summer time is a huge plus on muggy hot days!  Andersonville neighborhood is one of my favorite areas of Chicago. It is quaint, full of local  charm, great eats and drinks within walking distance, and a fantastic way to get a feel of what real Chicago is like (and not the fake touristy stuff). Off the beaten path geek thing we did - we drove to and walked through the nearby Rosehill Cemetery Mausoleum. The old original section has a substantial collection of LC Tiffany stained glass windows and walking the completely silent hallways to see the sun shining through these beautiful windows is pretty awesome if you like that sort of thing.  Love Jim's place! Beyond 5 stars! We will hopefully be back to town and rent out his apartment again in the future. ",1.0

So you guys are very nice  and  your hospitality goes beyond  what words can describe .  I know  past experiences  that Airbnb have change my life on how I stay in a city or a place of my travels keep up the good work.  So your place very  amazing  it’s worth every penny that I spend. I know that the  Quality  That I got can’t beat it in a hotel even a  Waldorf Astoria.  I will definitely come back and stay with you guys .

Chicago,Great apartment and location!!! Andersonville is a charming little neighborhood of Chicago. We easily took Uber/Lyft to and from the city and airport. I would highly recommend staying here. Thanks again!,1.0
Chicago,"The apartment was beautiful with 2 comfortable beds, with the bedrooms on opposite ends of the unit from each other.  A very short walk (few short blocks) from downtown Andersonville with all of it's shops and restaurants, with a farmers market every Wednesday. Beautiful area to walk around. I'd recommend it to anyone looking to stay in the area.",1.0
Chicago,"Jim and Maximo were great hosts! This spacious two-bed, one-bath is the perfect getaway for family and friends! I picked Andersonville, because it's a great LGBTQ+ friendly neighborhood and was a great location to experience all of the Pride festivities happening over the weekend during our stay. Jim and Maximo were super responsive and very accommodating throughout my entire experience even before arriving for the weekend! The neighborhood is a family-friendly area and was very walk-able with lots of places to go for food, coffee or to go grocery shopping. The apartment was very spacious, clean and had lots of cute touches/decorations to make the place feel like home. I will definitely look to stay here again in the future during my next visit to Chicago!",1.0

Perfect for business stays or a nice getaway. You won't regret staying here.",1.0
Chicago,"This place was phenomenal. It was just as pictured, the location is awesome to the city we visited, both hosts handled any/all things we needed/checked up on us, and all of our necessities were met and beyond. This was a very pleasurable stay and I would definitely recommend this place to friends if they ever come visit Chicago.   You have everything you need within a short walk and if you really need to, there’s a Target .7 miles from the place. Close eating and bar spots within a short walk. It takes about 20-30 min to get into Chicago.   Awesome visit and great hosts.",1.0
Chicago,"Jim & Maximo we’re outstanding hosts. Every detail of this beautiful apartment was lovely. The location was great for our stay in north Chicago. And while our schedule did not allow for it, we appreciated the tips on where to go in the neighborhood. Communication was excellent, and the extra comforts made us feel very welcome and comfortable. And the decorations are so charming!",1.0
Chicago,This is our favorite place to stay in Chicago!   The location is excellent!  The apartment is beautiful!  Jim and Maximo are excellent hosts and think of added details to make you feel right at home.   We look forward to our next stay.,1.0

We didn’t have a car and found it super easy to Uber most places outside the neighborhood. Thanks for a great stay!!",1.0
Chicago,"Loved Jim and Maximo’s place, it was very spacious, clean and stylish. I enjoyed looking through the magazines and the beds were extremely comfortable. The neighborhood is terrific, close enough to public transportation, cofffee shops, restaurants and not too far from the lake. Street parking was so easy, parked in front every time no matter what time of day. Thanks for an excellent experience for my family and me!",1.0
Chicago,"Jim’s place was (Website hidden by Airbnb) pictured and described...super cute, spacious, and comfy! Great neighborhood with access to awesome restaurants within walking distance, and easy ~12-15 min walk to red line to get into downtown. Our family also appreciated the local playgrounds and family vibe of the neighborhood. Jim and Maximo were wonderful hosts. They were quick to communicate with us and responsive to our needs. We would definitely stay again upon a return visit to Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"We really enjoyed staying at Jim's place over a quick weekend get-away to Chicago. It's very close to all the Andersonville shops and restaurants on Clark St. and a short walk to the el stop to go downtown; it's in a lovely, quiet, leafy neighborhood of brownstones. Parking was easy -- there was street parking right outside the apartment; we parked the car when we arrived Friday and didn't need to move it or use it until we left on Sunday. The apartment was very clean and well-appointed, with a great kitchen and nice amenities. Jim was there to give us the keys when we checked in; he and Maximo were available if needed but also gave us space. We'd highly recommend this one!",1.0
Chicago,"Stylish apartment in a great location with convenient parking and great restaurants/shops nearby. We really enjoyed our stay here. The kitchen had everything we needed to cook and prepare our own food. Jim was very responsive and accommodating, which made everything easy and enjoyable. I wish that we could have controlled the heat ourselves, but when the apartment started to get a bit chilly, we notified Jim, and he was able to turn on the heat for us quickly. Overall a great space and great experience!",1.0
Chicago,"Jim’s place is aesthetically pleasing, clean, and comfortable. It is in the lovely neighborhood of Andersonville and accessible to many restaurants and shops. I appreciated the clear communication, quick responses, ease of check in, and helpfulness when I needed to extend my stay. The house is well equipped with the conveniences and thoughtful touches that are helpful to a busy business traveler- a high quality iron and real ironing board, a washer and drier, toiletries, coffee etc.I would definitely stay at Jim’s place again.",1.0
Chicago,"We loved staying here! The place was beautiful, with many nice touches, a charming older building but remodelled with modern amenities, and sparkling clean. Getting in was very convenient, there were snacks left there for us to enjoy, parking on the street was easy, and Jim and Maximo always responded immediately to all of our queries, plus checked in to see if we wanted coffee, or needed anything else from them, checked on the comfort of the beds, and generally made sure that we had a great stay and felt well cared for. The kitchen is well appointed - the only thing not available was a microwave, but Maximo commented that he's about to get one for the apartment so that can be expected soon.  This is a great apartment with caring and involved hosts. I recommend staying here unconditionally!",1.0
Chicago,"The apartment was beautiful and very spacious. There are restaurants, grocery stores and pharmacies within walking distance. The neighborhood seemed very safe and we enjoyed walking around even in the cold weather. The Keurig and snack basket were nice touches which we appreciated. The beds were  too firm to be comfortable for me, but my boyfriend was fine with it, so it may be personal preference. Jim and Maximo were very attentive and always ready to help. Please note, the apartment does not have a microwave. Also, there is a policy that you cannot have any guest enter into the apartment (not just for sleeping, but for visiting too) which I misunderstood when booking, but it was not a problem since it was only the two of us. If you're traveling in a group or with family staying in other places, you may want to look for another place if you want them to be able to visit you. Overall our stay was lovely and we would recommend this apartment.",1.0
Chicago,"Location, location, location! The spot is located in a beautiful historic neighbourhood filled with lots of charm, great shops, and fantastic restaurants within walking distance. The space was incredibly clean, beautifully decorated, and had everything we needed for a great weekend. Jim was a great host and provided all the amenities we could have needed. 10/10 would stay here again!",1.0
Chicago,"This is a clean and beautifull apartment. Really clean and tidy, felt like home.  Close to coffee shops and general shops.  Jim and Maximo  checked up on me to make sure all my needs were meet and told me where the good coffee shops are. I highly recommend staying. I will deff come back in the future. 10/10 :)",1.0
Chicago,"This was my second stay at Ellie’s place, and I maintain that it’s one of the best Airbnbs ever! So quiet, clean, stylish, and comfortable. The tub is awesome and the coffee’s great, what more could I ask for?",1.0
Chicago,"Place was great! Clean, cozy, great location. Check in & out went seamlessly. LOVED the bathtub and shower. I would definitely recommend. The TV package was a surprising plus.. not usually one to hang out too much at a bnb- but after a day of drinking at Wrigley we were feeling a little rough-  it was so nice to just chill out the next day watching movies and ordering food! Loved it!",1.0
Chicago,"As a single traveler the studio set up was perfect for me. The location was great, since I had just been staying downtown at a conference prior to my stay it was nice to get out a bit and see some other neighborhoods. I could easily walk to the 606 Trail - which I really enjoyed - and N Milwaukee Ave for some fun shopping. I appreciated the guide they had in the studio with local recommendations listed, I got take-out from the Indian place down the street and it was delicious. Very comfortable bed!",1.0
Chicago,"Elinor went above and beyond to accommodate our stay, the level of hospitality was excellent!   The space is gorgeous and welcoming. I love that every detail was thought out, and this carries out throughout all the pieces in the home. Definitely a gem in the city.",1.0

Chicago,"I absolutely loved this place! I already told my sister that when we get the chance to go to Chicago together we will absolutely have to stay there. It was the perfect size and had everything I needed. The style of the whole place was gorgeous. I can tell a lot of thought went into creating this space. The shower and bathtub were amazing, and it was very helpful that there was a hair dryer, shampoo/conditioner, body wash, etc. When I do get the chance to travel to Chicago again I hope this is available. I can’t say enough about how much I loved this place!",1.0
Chicago,"From the incredibly easy check in and location, to the thoughtful touches that made us feel at home, to the impeccably curated style, we absolutely loved stayed here. It will be our go to any time we are back in Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"What can I say except that Elinor’s place was great! The little touches, such as welcome beers, pour over coffee, books on Chicago, and available toilet trees (we flew in and only had carry-one) were perfect. We only used the room for sleeping since we spent most of our day and night exploring the city! The weather is Chicago sure is unpredictable and crazy, so make sure you have a jacket or umbrella on stand by! Haha Thank you again for allowing us to stay in your lovely place!",1.0
Chicago,"We loved this place! It has all of the amenities and comfort of a nice hotel and more. The space was stunning, just like the photos. It felt very private which was great. We appreciated all of the books about Chicago and local restaurants. We’ll be back!",1.0
Chicago,This place is exactly as it looks! Super cute with personal touches so you know you’re getting an authentic experience. It’s close enough to the L to make traveling to and from the city accessible! Would for sure stay here again; wish I had more time :),1.0
Chicago,"OMG this place is so fantastic. It's PERFECT. I'm going to stay here again for sure! Great location, excellent host, so stylish and cool. The place also comes with an amazing little booklet to tell you how to use the WiFi and coffeemaker, and how to get around.",1.0
Chicago,"If I had more a sense of self-interest, I would write the  worst review ever so that this amazing space is always available for me when I'm in Chicago. First: it is it's own little building in the city. Wow! It's designed so beautifully, I took tons of photos to inspire my guest house back in CT. Elinor was responsive, accommodating, and super nice. I'm spreading the word to all of my friends who are jazzed staying there. The location is 10-12 minutes from downtown... well worth it for these gorgeous accommodations. BTW: the photos don't really capture the details and inviting sweetness of the place. I'll see you again, Elinor!",1.0
Chicago,"Ellie and Devin's space is charming! It's a well-designed, well-maintained large studio with incredibly thoughtful touches: books about the history of Chicago, more books from Chicago based writers and poets, games, postcards, and even stamps. I was a little nervous the first night with the studio being so close to the street, but I slept like a dream – the bed is comfortable and the studio is airy and bright. The place is exactly as pictured, even better. Ellie and Devin were very responsive and helpful. I would definitely come back and highly recommend staying here.",1.0
Chicago,This place is in the best part of the city! So easy to walk everywhere! It is clean with amazing amenities! The cute little touches! The great bath and shower! The delicious pour-over coffee! I want to stay there again.,1.0
Chicago,Elinor’s apartment is the perfect place for a cozy and stylish stay in Chicago. Everything we could’ve needed was provided and Elinor’s neighborhood recommendations were superb! I would highly recommend this place to anyone wanting to visit Chicago (and to avoid tourist traps)!,1.0
Chicago,"I can’t say it enough- this is THE best Airbnb I’ve ever stayed at and is so cozy! It’s worth every penny! I came to take my boards and it was just perfect for the stay. It’s so stylish, quaint, adorable neighborhood, and the little touches are unlimited! There was wine and beer stocked in the fridge, a cute pour over coffee pot and trader joe beans with a grinder! Basically I’m sad I can’t just move and stay in forever. People always say, “oh I’ll be back” but this is serious, I can’t wait to book again! I have best friends who live in the city and I’d still pay to stay in this awesome space! Airbnb MVP! Don’t hesitate! Book it now!",1.0
Chicago,"What you see on the photos are absolutely accurate and more! Loved the open space, high ceilings and obviously the bath. I've been using Airbnb for most of my travels and this is one of the nicest and most aesthetically pleasing location I have ever stayed at!",1.0
Chicago,"My fiancé and I were in town to celebrate our anniversary weekend. We couldn't have picked a better place to stay. The open layout, soft lighting, and claw foot tub all made it seem like a dream. Thank you so much!",1.0
Chicago,"Ellie was fantastic, super fast responses to my emails. Her place was fantastic, and right in the neighborhood where we needed to be. Hate to say this, but she could easily get more per night given the location and how awesome the space is.   Cheers!",1.0
Chicago,"Great place! Great host! We actually had major delays on our flight out of Chicago and she offered for us to stay another night. We felt loved and cared for. If you want a spot not in the downtown hustle but still in the city enough to Uber for good rates, look no further. Quiet neighborhood. Pictures described the space very accurately. It was the perfect space for a quick getaway to Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"Amazing and beautiful first airbnb experience. The place was decorated very modern and was clean. Both the walk in shower and claw-foot tub were great and the water got very hot. The bed was super comfy! There were plenty of towels, extra sheets, and blankets to use as well. There were also nice personal touches such as food recommendations and stocked beverages in the fridge (water filter, coffee, and some wine). Me and my boyfriend had an amazing time.",1.0
Chicago,"Wonderful place to stay while visiting the windy city of Chicago! Not far from great restaurant, bars, shopping and downtown. The coach house is decorated to perfection in mid-century modern decor and very clean. My husband and I used Uber all weekend and waiting no longer than 2 min. for a pickup at the house.  Highly recommend a stay at this location.",1.0
Chicago,"Great place to stay in Chicago. The space is very functionable and artsy, open and airy- we loved it. Comfy bed, all amenities you would want and then far more are provided. There are even beautiful post cards for you to write home with! Highly recommend it!",1.0
Chicago,Ellie’s place is exactly what you see in the all - no false advertising. It’s very light and open and she maximizes the space greatly. She’s very easy to communicate with. The Damen & Western L stations are close enough walk which we utilized a lot. Would definitely stay here again!,1.0
Chicago,"Gorgeous! I loved staying here. It was in a cool neighborhood and the studio was clean, styled well, and the bathroom was top notch. I want to stay here every time I come back to Chicago. They also have postcards and stamps for your use. Sweet little detail. Thanks so much!",1.0
Chicago,"This is a fantastic place. Super bright, extremely clean, great design, and extremely comfortable. Parking was easy. Check in and check out were super convenient and Elinor was very responsive. Can’t recommend highly enough!",1.0
Chicago,Eleanor's place was fantastic! Every detail was thought of including the courtesy postcards depicting her cat who sits in the window in the house on Artesian Street on the front. I would come back to Chicago just to hang out in this cool Studio for a weekend.,1.0
Chicago,"This is a gem of a space that is a close walk to some great cafes, shopping, and night life. As someone who travels a fair amount, I would say this was one of my favorite stays at an AirBNB. The space itself is very thoughtfully curated. ",1.0
Chicago,"There is a reason so many reviews start with how stylish the place is. That reason is because it is stunning and just as advertised! The level of detail and thought put in to the design is unbelievable.   Location is great, quick walk to the blue line. Check in/out is super easy, and the studio manual made our interactions minimal.   Great place to stay, will absolutely repeat.   Thanks again!",1.0
Chicago,"This place was great. It's worth the price just to swim around in that huge bathtub. Ellie was a great host, and the apartment had everything you could need for a great time in Chicago. I found most places I needed to go (food, cute shops, metro) to be about a ~10 min walk away, which I don't mind because I love to walk, but if you don't consider getting a car. It was really easy to get to downtown using the train. I have no complaints, this was an awesome  place!",1.0
Chicago,"This is such a cute, clean and comfortable space! I could stay here for weeks! Nice little neighborhood. Had initially worried about noise at night, but it did quiet down for a restful evening.  The fresh ground coffee, sodas, beer help to make it comfortable. Nice distance from downtown. Safe to run in the mornings with a park nearby. Love this place!",1.0
Chicago,"Ellie’s studio is absolutely stunning! She goes above & beyond for her guest! There are loads of local nicknacks laying around the studio to indulge into. She has her cabinets stocked with things one might need (ibuprofen, cotton swabs, razors, etc). The neighbor hood is very nice. There are not many of taxi’s in the area, so if you don’t drive one might want to download uber. Definitely worth the stay! Would definitely come back!",1.0
Chicago,"Fantastic stay! The studio was as pristine as pictured. You felt more like you were staying in a hotel than someone's home. Great amenities like shampoo, soft towels and even yoga mats! Would highly recommend,",1.0
Chicago,"Elinor's studio was a magical place, and I could tell as I soon as I stepped up to the door, because care was taken in styling the exterior with little faerie lights that sparkled. I hate to say this, but I can be a bit of snob when it comes aesthetic and decor. I have not one complaint about this studio. I was absolutely blown away. The incredible level of detail and design, even down to the studio's handbook was meticulous and thought out.  What's even more wonderful is the central location to all the haunts in the Bucktown/Wicker Park area. I drove and literally everywhere I went was less than a 10 minutes away. I can't imagine that taking public transportation would take any longer. If you do drive, Elinor provides a parking permit, which gives you the freedom to park anywhere in the vivinity without the fear of getting a ticket.  By far Elinor's place is one of the best spots I've stayed in for Air BnB. If you're looking for something magical and romantic (oh, I forgot to mention there's wonderfully restored claw-foot Victorian bath tub) look no further.",1.0
Chicago,Stayed here while visiting Chicago. The apartment was really clean and cozy and located in a really good location for our trip. We were able to park right out front for our stay and walk everywhere. If you're looking to spend time in the Ukrainian Village i would recommend staying here. Close to the train if ya want to travel other places too.,1.0
Chicago,"The initial observation of the space was of course a stylish space for a reasonable price.  Seeing the space in person is such an enjoyable experience - especially when noticing all the fine details not revealed in the online pics.  It is in those details that raises the level of impression and sets it apart from other spaces.    Elinor and I had minimal contact, but that was because instructions were clear on the check-in and check-out procedures, where to park, and even how to make the coffee - which we were thoroughly confused at first.    I enjoy exploring different places to stay when visiting areas, but I would consider staying here again on my next trip to Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"I enjoyed my stay at Elinor's studio apartment in Wicker Park.  The location was pefect for me.  The studio was quite stylish and had many personal touches, including a studio manual which I found quite helpful and fun.  I really appreciated the 2 bottles of wine and the beer selection in the fridge.  The kitchen was minimal but that was fine with me because I planned to enjoy Chicago's dining scene.  The bed was  very confortable, which was a definite plus.  The heater was somewhat louder than I was expecting, but that is the only concern I had.  I would definitely stay here again.",1.0
Chicago,"This is a great spot. Located near hip Wicker Park and related. Quiet, good access to Metro and very pleasant spot to hang out and do some work too. Hostess was very helpful on restaurants etc . This is a top BnB!!!",1.0
Chicago,"The space is exactly as described. Gorgeous. The bathroom is stylish, clean, and the shower is great. Would love to have a space like that in my own home tbh. They have cute touches throughout the studio, including Where Chefs Eat (I have that at home too!) and Studs Terkel's ""Working"" in the bathroom. The bed was really comfortable and once we figured out how to configure the NEST properly for our purposes, the temperature control was on point. One minor note is that both heat and cool air come out predominantly at the head of the bed, and it could be bothersome to people who are sensitive to dry air. My wife had to turn to the foot of the bed one night because she's super sensitive, but it didn't bother me much. The location was good for me because I don't need to be right downtown and don't mind taking a Lyft everywhere, plus I like to be in ""real"" neighborhoods. Puerto Rican restaurants abound as well as cool street art, if you care to venture around. It's about a twenty minute drive to many downtown area attractions. The hosts were very accommodating to my needs, as I had to cancel one day due to a family emergency. They were very easy to work with throughout. Will definitely look to return here my next stay in Chicago",1.0
Chicago,Elinor's place is close to perfect. Every corner of the space is thoughtfully detailed and styled. It's located very centrally to Logan Square and the Bucktown/Wicker Park area and I enjoyed walking the neighborhood in my downtime. Her communication was clear and extremely quick and I truly cannot say enough about how pleasant my stay was. Highly recommended.,1.0
Chicago,"Before I arrived, I loved the photos and thought the place would be perfect for my stay over New Year's. Walking in, it was somehow even better. From the furniture to the lighting to the tableware, everything in the space is very intentionally curated. I have a feeling the owners are designers; the whole place has a great aesthetic while still being comfortable. One of my favorite places I've stayed so far",1.0
Chicago,"We had a great stay at this charming, stylish studio. Clean digs and thoughtful touches like coffee, beer, and wine were lovely. Location was perfect for getting around town by foot or Lyft, yet the street itself was quiet and residential. Great host communication and simple check in and check out. Would stay again in a heartbeat!",1.0
Chicago,"I love this spot . The layout, decor and vibe are definitely hip. Everything is so easy + the communication with Elinor is on point. The amenities are great . The experience is very hommie , every time you discover little details that make a difference in your stay.   If you’re looking for something local, not loud ,  away from tourists this is definitely a good location.",1.0
Chicago,"Ellie’s place is so so wonderful! Chic, stylish, beautiful location from which you can easily access the trendiest Chicago area, Wicker Park. Ellie responds in mere minutes should you need anything and the keypad entry makes it so easy to come and go as you please, no need for keys! 10/10 would recommend and hope to stay here again! ❤️",1.0
Chicago,"Beautiful decor with so much space! Instructions for checkin were easy to follow. The coffee and extras were great!  Very comfortable bed! The apartment has an urban ambiance. Jeremy provided parking passes and we were able to find parking a block away. Communication was excellent. Jeremy answered any questions I had almost immediately. Neighborhood had a safe feel. We walked to local restaurants close by. One unfortunate thing, which was no fault of our host- when we went to leave, we discoveredthat our catalytic converter was stolen off of our car. I had driven our older SUV since I knew it would be parked for several days. Turns out, these are easiervehicles to get under and cut. I would not hesitate to stay here again.",1.0
Chicago,"This Airbnb is the best! Location and space are the key highlights! Jeremy has great design taste! Close to the train and many restaurants. We would definitely stay here again! If you’re visiting, try the rolled ice cream across the street! We had it twice!",1.0
Chicago,"The apartment was absolutely fantastic and everything was as good as advertised. The entire unit was much more spacious than it appeared in the photos which was a welcomed surprise as I have stayed in several Airbnb's that were smaller than photographed.   You could not ask for a better location, one block from the blue line which made traveling to/from O'Hare and into downtown a breeze. You're also within walking distance to countless top notch restaurants and shops.  Jeremy was a very responsive and accommodating host and he really made us feel taken care of when we had some flight plan changes. I would recommend this apartment to anyone wanting to visit Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"There is much to like about this apartment.  It's spacious, has full amenities, plenty of character, parking is included, and the place is clean.  Wicker Park is growing, has a unique vibe, feels safe, and offers options within walking distance for groceries.  The area also has many choices for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and drinks.  We chose to use the kitchen for breakfast, and the waffle maker was a great perk.  A critical factor in comfort, rest and relaxation is the bed.  While clean, we found the mattress to be uncomfortable.  It currently presents itself as firm and lumpy with indentations and sag from years of use.  Upgrading this one very important item would make this location, apartment, and experience worth renting again.  We enjoyed our stay overall and will keep this as an option in the future.",1.0
Chicago,"Came to Chicago for my cousin's birthday party. It was in my old neighborhood, so I felt very much at home. The place was spacious and exactly how it was described! I briefly meet Jeremy when I arrived, he was extremely nice. Would love to come back here when I visit Chicago again.",1.0
Chicago,"I loved this loft and everything about it.  The location was great - 1.5 blocks from the CTA - we were able to explore the entire city using public transportation.  Check in and check out were a breeze.  Jeremy was kind and offered great suggestions when we met briefly during the stay.  The apartment was spotlessly clean, comfortable, quiet and well appointed.  This was my first visit to Chicago and I would gladly stay here on my next trip.",1.0
Chicago,"We loved this place. It's spacious and very convenient. If you have small children, you may want to know that there is a firehouse nearby, but it did not bother us, we expected city noises. There's a Metro station barely a block away. It's great to have a washer and dryer right in the apartment since we tend to pack very lightly. We greatly appreciated the neighborhood parking stickers Jeremey provided and we easily found parking about 1 block away on a safe, residential street. We'll stay here again next time we're in town.",1.0
Chicago,"This is a large, 1 bedroom apartment within 2 blocks of the blue line. Very convenient! There’s a well equipped full kitchen with a small grocery across the street. Of course there a numerous great restaurants in the area so there’s no need to cook. The apartment was very comfortable and clean. We had plenty of pillows, blankets, towels etc. which was much appreciated.",1.0
Chicago,"This was my very first AirBnB and if all of them are like this one, I'll never stay in a hotel again. Jeremey's communication was excellent from start to finish and his home is so beautiful and immaculate. It is easy to find and right off the blue line. The home had EVERYTHING I needed and then some. He even left me 2 day parking passes for the area which made people coming by easy to park nearby. It is in a very cool neighborhood and as a single woman staying in an area I've never been, I felt very safe. When I visit again, I would definitely stay there again.",1.0
Chicago,Jeremey is a wonderful host and his place is extremely nice. He is quick to respond with any questions and is willing to give recommendations around the city. The place was clean and decorated with care. It has everything you would need during your stay.,1.0
Chicago,"Jeremy's apartment is exactly as advertised - stylish, large, comfortable and spotlessly clean in a very safe, hip neighborhood.  The kitchen has all you would need to fix your own meals.  We, however, opted to take advantage of the multitude of excellent bars, coffee shops and restaurants within very easy walking distance on Division Street and North Milwaukee Avenue (for lovers of high quality Nepalese / Indian food we recommend Cumin on North Milwaukee). Communication with Jeremy was very easy.  If and when we return to this part of Chicago Wicker we would, without hesitation choose to stay in Jeremy's place.",1.0
Chicago,"We were very pleased with the apartment. With an updated modern kitchen and bathroom we had everything we needed to be comfortable. Jeremy was a great host, communicated all details we needed when needed.",1.0
Chicago,Jeremy's place was fantastic! It is really big. Was great to unpack and have space and feel at home. Really close to the blue line. Easy to get anywhere. Felt safe in the neighborhood. Fire station next door but never bothered us or woke us up. Would definitely stay again!,1.0
Chicago,Our stay was great! Jeremey was very responsive when we asked him about accommodating our two dogs during the stay. There was even a small crate provided that we ended up using for the smaller pup. Everything was just as described and the apartment is close to many great restaurants and shops. We'd stay again! :),1.0
Chicago,"Jeremey's place is fantastic -- it's bigger than we were expecting and has a really nice overall feel to it.  It's nicely decorated and has all the amenities you would need.  Jeremey was very quick to respond to messages and helped out if anything at all was needed.  Check-in was simple and the building felt secure.  It's just a couple minutes' walk to the blue line, which brings you right into downtown in about 10 minutes.  Also close to some cool spots on N Milwaukee, like Oiistar, the amazing ramen place.  Super nice experience and we'd definitely stay with Jeremey again!",1.0
Chicago,"This was perfect for our needs.  Everything was as advertised.  It's a beautiful space and the location is great.  (Ashland itself is not too appealing but you're a one-minute walk from blue line, can stroll west on Division or walk up Milwaukee Ave to Bucktown.).  Self-checkin was super easy and we had everything we needed.",1.0
Chicago,"Jeremy was very responsive, answering all questions quickly and thoroughly.  His place was nice and very clean.  My parents stayed at the Air BnB to visit me and were quite pleased.  Being that I own and live in downtown Chicago, I can say that this location fantastic and the price to be a great value.",1.0
Chicago,This place is one of the nicest accommodations I have ever stayed at. Yes the price is expensive compared to a hotel but if you want a solid night's sleep and little slice of home be sure to check out Jeremy's place!,1.0
Chicago,Wonderful place.  We really enjoyed ourselves and relaxed at Jeremey's loft.  Very clean.  We enjoyed being able to watch people on the streets from the loft.  Love the mixture of cultures which we don't get much of back home.  Location was great.  Very quick walk to get to Wicker Park and many great local restaurants as well.  Felt very safe in the neighborhood and at Jeremey's place.  Super nice people.  Jeremey is fantastic at returning messages.  Always a quick reply and we had no problems at all that couldn't be fixed quickly.  Highly recommend Jeremey's loft!,1.0
Chicago,"Jeremey's apartment far exceeded our expectations.  The pictures don't do justice to how beautiful, stylish and very spacious this place is, not to mention comfortable and clean.  Everything was simply perfect.  Every possible amenity to make you feel right at home--we wanted for nothing.  Comfortable bed and couches, beautiful, roomy bathroom with large shower and plenty of hot water, fully stocked kitchen, excellent wi-fi and incredibly easy check-in process. We loved the location, merely 2 short blocks (roughly 3 min) walk to the Blue line on the L/ subway.  So easy to get to the main attractions downtown, but also in a great spot to explore the Wicker Park/ West Town neighborhoods and all the great restaurants and shops.  An excellent Airbnb experience--Thank you, Jeremey!!",1.0
Chicago,We found it exactly as advertised—perhaps even better. Super accommodations in a great location. Jeremey was very accessible and promptly responded to our requests and questions. We look forward to staying there again on our next trip to Chicago.,1.0
Chicago,We LOVED the location. The area seemed very safe and was central to the blue line and a Divvy bike station. (Tip: take the blue line to and from O’hare to save a lot of money on transportation) The apartment was very roomy and we enjoyed having access to a kitchen. Something to note is the TV does not have cable or “smart” access. We ended up buying a firestick so we had something to watch while winding down at the end of our days. Jeremy was quick to respond any time we had questions or needed anything! Thank you for a great stay!,1.0
Chicago,"Better than it looked online, a beautiful space with everything needed and then some. Great location, close to public transportation and wonderful local spots. Jeremy was attentive and helpful with all of my queries. Would stay here whenever I’m in Chicago. Can’t recom enough!",1.0
Chicago,"This is a beautiful unit in a great neighborhood in Chicago.  Jeremy was a great host and was easy to communicate with.  Check-in and check-out were a breeze and the apartment was spotless.  It's on a busy street but there was very little noise.  The blue line is a block away as are Target, CVS and a bunch of great coffee shops and places to eat.  Also super easy to pick up a cab or an Uber/Lyft.  Would recommend this place without hesitation!",1.0
Chicago,Communication was fast and easy and Jeremey was available every step of the way.    Apartment was better than I expected.  Great location and very close to the Blue Line which can get you just about anywhere.     Would absolutely recommend and would stay here again in the future.   ,1.0
Chicago,"This is a spacious apartment and very nicely furnished. The location is just a few minutes walk from the blue line with quick transportation direct to the heart of downtown. Check-in was easy and the host provided a sheet with lots of helpful suggestions for local eating places, of which there are many.  Staying at Jeremey's place for 4 nights provided a very comfortable place to stay for our tired bodies after spending our days exploring Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,Jeremey’s place is very spacious and clean.  It has everything you need for a short or long term stay.  Jeremey is very nice and answers any question very promptly.  The location is also very convenient for travel on public transport.  Highly recommended!,1.0
Chicago,"Couldn't have asked for a better place. It was super easy to get to and from both town and O'Hare, with a Blue Line stop only one block away. It was beautiful and cheerful as well. Loved the full kitchen and nice extra-large tub. Jeremey was a lovely host. I wish we could have stayed even longer!",1.0
Chicago,"Great location with convenient transportation. The neighborhood has a cool vibe. As a vinyl record collector, I was excited about being across the street from Dusty Groove and close to Reckless Records. Great overall experience.",1.0
Chicago,"My wife and I spent 2 nights at Jeremey's place. While pictures can often be deceiving, we were pleasantly surprised at how large and open the apartment was in person. It was perfect. Jeremey was traveling in Spain at the time, but he was quick to respond to questions we had the day of and during the trip about things such as checking in and adjusting the nest thermostat. We'd happily stay there again.",1.0
Chicago,Great space in a convenient location—a vibrant neighborhood and just a block from blue line. The apartment has a good vibe and personality and is very clean. Jeremy was attentive and responsive. I’ll go back.,1.0
Chicago,"Jeremey's apartment is really great. It's large and bright in all the right places (and quieter and darker in the bedroom, which is lovely for sleeping), stylishly decorated (without being overdone--the decor fits the urban space perfectly), has a fantastic shower, everything you need for a comfortable stay and is in one of my favorite Chicago neighborhoods, with a bajiggety restaurants, bars, shops, etc. The provided parking passes are super helpful, especially for weekend stays, because parking in this part of the city is no joke (in fact, if you can manage without a car, do, because you won't need it once you're here--everything is walkable, lyft/uber is plentiful and the El train is literally right there.)  If mobility is an issue for you, you should know that you have to walk up a flight of steep, narrow stairs to get to the apartment. Also, it's really in the real city, and real cities generally aren't that quiet, so if you're a super sensitive sleeper who needs deep, dark silence, you'll maybe want to bring ear plugs and/or a sleep mask.   But otherwise, I completely recommend this place. Jeremey is a kind, helpful and responsive host, the apartment is so lovely, and it's a really great value for Chicago, too.",1.0
Chicago,"We enjoyed our stay at Jeremy’s place. It's conveniently located, about 15 minutes to the loop and 20 minutes to Midway airport. Although we got around with Uber, the blue line is just minutes across the street. The apartment is super clean and lovely decorated. Jeremy is very thoughtful with the travel guide and tips. It was great to meet a Cal alumni at Chicago. =) I would recommend this listing to everyone.",1.0
Chicago,"This home was great. Jeremey provided easy check in details and instructions. The location was great because I was close to everything downtown and many shops and stores. I recommend this home and would certainly stay here again. Thanks again, Jeremey!",1.0
Chicago,"Jeremy was easily accessible for any questions via text and he even checked in the second day to make sure everything was okay. The apartment spacious, comfortable and centrally located. Just a few steps to the blue line CTA train, restaurants and shops. The neighborhood is busy so the provided parking permits were a huge plus.",1.0
Chicago,"This space is amazing. Plenty of room, furnishings are great, kitchen has everything you could need, and the shower was perfect after a long day of exploring Chicago in the cold. Jeremey was prompt with responses and great about giving me tips on places to check out. Literally just a few steps away from the Blue Line which made getting around the city super easy. I will definitely be looking to get this place again next time I am in Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"Great place! We stayed there with our 18month during our summer holiday trip, all three of us loved Jeremey’s place. Bigger than expected. Jeremey was very supportive and fast with all kind of questions. We can highly recommend this place, also when you are traveling with small children.",1.0
Chicago,"What a great stay in Chicago!!! Jeremey‘s loft is perfectly situated in one of our favourite areas within Chicago. There are so many things to explore in walking distance: restaurants, shopping, parks, and the great 606 trail. The train („L“, blue line) - which is more or less directly in front of the apartment - connects you directly with downtown as well as with the airport. The apartment is so cool, we would love to live there! Despite the busy street in front of the house the apartments inside is so quiet and we slept like babies. Jeremey is a fantastic host and helped us a lot to find our ways, gave us great recommendations and answered immediately whenever we wrote a message. We will definitely come again!!!",1.0
Chicago,"A very spacious and spotlessly clean apartment, it holds special charm with bare brick walls and wooden floors with plenty of seating and a very large bed with a well equipped dressing room.  The bathroom is great with a very impressive bath for easing away the muscles after a long day of exploring.  We didn’t use the kitchen much apart from making a hot drink as we ate out most of the time but there is a great health food shop just opposite and a food shop just by the subway station.  Although we didn’t get to meet Jeremey his communication with us was superb.",1.0
Chicago,"Jeremy’s place is amazing, not only is it huge, it has everything you need for a comfortable stay, it’s in a great location for getting around town (literally one minute walk from the blue line at Division), and really easy to get to on the blue line from O’hare airport.  Jeremy was a fantastic host, very quick to respond to any queries we had, and was kind enough to let us leave our bags for a couple of hours while we went for brunch before heading back to the airport.  I would highly recommend his apartment to anyone wanting to explore Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,We had a very nice stay at Jeremy’s Airbnb. Lots of space and a big kitchen. Jeremy responds quickly to questions and everything went very smooth. It is in a good location if you want to explore Wicker Park.,1.0
Chicago,"Really enjoyed spending a few days in Jeremey's place. Great location with Intelligentsia across the road, as well as La Pasadita and a good grocery store too. Warm, clean and cosy. Would definitely return.",1.0

Chicago,"This is a beautiful apartment, so wonderfully kept! Jeremy was a wonderful host and despite the fact that we had a mx up during checkout, he was patient and kind and just te consummate host. The apartment is wonderful, the area is well connected and I would stay here again In a heartbeat. ",1.0
Chicago,"Jeremey’s place is so beautiful, a perfect loft you could imagine with a view to a quiet street. It has lots of light, in the morning or in the evening too. Subway is 1 minute walking distance (literally)! Fire station in the adjacent building is not bothering at all, they turned out to be the most quiet neighbors we ever had :) Many thanks to Jeremey, we would like to return!",1.0
Chicago,Beautiful apartment thats is decorated to perfection. Its conveniently located (10 min walk to wicker park and 20 min subway to downtown). Jeremy was very accommodating and his local coffee & donut tips were great!,1.0
Chicago,"Rob’s place was beautiful! It looked exactly as advertised. The apartment was spacious & stylishly decorated. Lots of restaurants & bars within walking distance, as well as a grocery store. Rob was super responsive & hospitable. We were not able to check in before 3, but he allowed us to leave our luggage in his store prior to check in & even took it upstairs to the apartment for us! The only downside was that the bedroom can get a little warm, especially on a hot summer day. Other than that, we fully enjoyed our stay. Would definitely stay here again!",1.0
Chicago,"Rob’s Place was beautifully furnished and decorated. It was also only a 3 minute walk from the nearest bus stop which can take you to downtown or any of the metro/L lines - very convenient. The only downside is that there is no air conditioning in the bedroom so it got really hot. It is also on the 3rd floor so that’s something to consider if you don’t like taking the stairs. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and would recommend it!",1.0
Chicago,Rob's place is immaculate! I have never seen an Airbnb so tastefully decorated and cozy. Its in the middle of a bustling restaurant and shopping district but is surprisingly quiet. Rob himself was very responsive and a great host. I would definitely come back here for sure. Make sure you take advantage of the $20/day parking that Rob offers. It was a lifesaver.,1.0
Chicago,"My experience could not have been better. This was the mog immaculate, stylish, modern, and comfortable AirBnB experience I've ever had. The owner has spared no expense, from stainless steel alliances to remodeled bathrooms and showers, to new wood flooring. The temper-pedic bed was heavenly, and the furnishings were modern and comfortable. The attention to detail was unparalleled, from train maps and restaurant guides to Chicago artwork and plenty of cooking utensils and supplies, as well as beauty and hygiene products. I was beyond impressed with the level of care and consideration.   When I return to Chicago in the future, this will be my first choice. Always.",1.0
Chicago,We were In Chicago to see Hamilton and sightsee with our teenaged daughter. We loved this location and neighborhood. It felt safe and there were tons of nearby places to eat or get groceries. The condo itself was extremely clean and was well stocked with necessities. It was spacious and we never felt crowded. Rob was a great host and was very responsive to our questions. It was a plus to have  parking available as we never moved our car until we left Chicago. I would definitely rent from Rob again,1.0
Chicago,"Rob's place is incredibly stylish, supremely located, and overall provides a comfortable, beautiful perch from which to explore the city of Chicago.  As a host, Rob was incredibly hospitable and communicative, and was very helpful in getting me situated for the stay.  I highly recommend the apartment and would definitely stay here again!",1.0
Chicago,"This place is a fantastic stay!  Everything is wonderfully decorated, well thought-out, very clean, and it has an authenticity you can only find in a beautiful historic building.  The location is great as well. It’s a 13 minute drive to downtown Chicago, and 500 feet from the best breakfast place in town “Whisk”. You must go there!  Only thing missing in the Airbnb was coffee, so you may want to bring your own. But they have multiple ways to make it if you do.  Great stay, highly recommend this Airbnb!",1.0
Chicago,My wife and I came in to Chicago for our wedding anniversary and are so glad we chose to stay with Rob.  Probably the best Airbnb experience we’ve had.  He really thinks of everything and we can’t recommend staying here enough.,1.0
Chicago,Rob’ s space is 5 stars & beyond. He has gone the extra steps to make his guests well informed about the neighborhood & totally took care of everything you need to be comfortable away from your home. This Airbnb is the cleanest place we have ever stayed in.!!! You feel like you are his VERY FIRST guests! The photos give you a glimpse of the home but it out shines even those.

Chicago,"By far-this Rob's place is the most STUNNING home my husband and I stayed in. The décor is stylish, modern and pure class. The Holiday decorations made it festive and cozy. I really want those flocked trees!! LOL Absolutely gorgeous. The pictures of this listing does it NO JUSTICE!! Rob is a delight and one of thee most gracious hosts I have encountered. His level of hospitality is unparalleled and he gave us some great suggestions of local eateries in the area. His home is in great proximity to downtown and other neighborhoods. We truly could not be more pleased and dreaded leaving to return back to our home state. However, we will certainly be back and definitely in the process of making plans to book Rob's home again. You will not be disappointed!! Truly his home is a GEM!!!",1.0
Chicago,"The warmest home we've ever been in. Sparkling clean, modern and superb interior design, great location and a very lovely, warm host. Thank you, Rob and we promise to only stay at your place whenever we're in Chicago! An experience to remember!",1.0
Chicago,"This was the cleanest Airbnb we’ve ever stayed in. If you are picky with finding a clean place that actually FEELS clean, this home is for you. You can immediately tell that Rob takes pride in his apartment and everything is so well maintained and stylishly decorated. The bed was a welcomed place for rest after a long day, and we loved how firm the mattress was and how fluffy the pillows were—very comfortable.  The amenities were spot on, the coffeemaker, the gas stove, plenty of dishes and quality cookware to use for making a meal. Not mention, the exceptional decor of the entire apartment! The location was excellent and walkable to numerous local restaurants and bars (a few were literally steps from the apartment door). We loved being on the third floor and always felt super safe. There is some traffic noise that can be heard in the bedroom, but Rob provides earplugs for light sleepers. In truth, we actually enjoyed being lulled to sleep by the sounds of the city and it didn’t bother us at all. The convenience of the grocery store being a 5 minute walk away made buying some pantry and fridge essentials easy. The couch in the living room was super comfy and perfect for relaxing and watching the Thanksgiving Day parade and some Netflix Christmas movies. This was the perfect Airbnb and we were highly impressed (not always easy). 5 stars to Rob for such an amazingly clean, comfortable, stylish, and well thought out home away from home. We’ll be back soon!",1.0
Chicago,"This place is so much nicer in person! And wow the bed was so comfortable we ended up sleeping the first night we got there instead of going out because we got trapped in the bed lol. Communicating with Rob was very easy and his home was supplied with everything!! First aid kit, make up remover wipes you name it lol. The home is in a very quiet and safe neighborhood. Would definitely stay again, one of the nicest places I have ever stayed!",1.0
Chicago,"We had a short but wonderful stay at Rob's place for a weekend trip to Chicago. Communication and check-in were quick and easy, and it was a breeze to get there from the airport on the train and a bus.  The space was spotlessly clean and beautifully furnished, with thoughtful touches that made our stay really comfortable. The location is great too, with a grocery store nearby and lots of good food/drink options as well.  Our only regrets are that we didn't stay here longer to enjoy it more and that we had to catch a Sunday morning flight before we could peruse the beautiful store downstairs some more. We would definitely stay here again, and will happily recommend it to any family and friends who may be looking for a place to stay in Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"Rob’s apartment was exactly what we need for a wonderful stay in Chicago. It was styled beautifully and Rob provided everything we could possibly need- thought of everything!

I will most certainly stay here again.",1.0
Chicago,"This might be my favorite Airbnb stay to date. The apartment so stunning, clean, and comfortable and charming Ukrainian Village with so much to offer, we chose to make fewer trips into the heart of the city to spend more time enjoying and exploring the immediate surroundings both in and out of the apartment. Yoga, restaurants, shops, grocery...everything within walking distance and this little oasis to temporarily call home. Rob couldn’t have been a better host. Will be back for sure!",1.0
Chicago,Rob’s place was amazing. Right in the center of everything. The location was close to many restaurants and bars. It is also a short ride to surrounding neighborhoods and downtown. The place itself was amazing with all the amenities needed for a great stay. Rob was prompt in his communication and was right below if needed. The parking space was a bonus as it is hard to find parking in this neighborhood without a permit.,1.0
Chicago,"Location, atmosphere, beautiful decor, every thought to amenities (even a First Aid Kit!)... you simply can't go wrong with this great condo in Ukrainian Village.  It was a snowy weekend so we especially enjoyed the cabinet full of games!  We were visiting family in Streeterville and getting there was no problem at all.  Rob greeted us when I arrived, and check-out was very simple.  Also, my brother drove over from a neighboring city to meet me, so we appreciated the off-street parking for him and his daughter.  Stay with Rob!  You won't regret it.",1.0
Chicago,"This is a stylish, modern yet comfortable apartment located in a cool part of town with lots of options to dine and a young at heart hip vibe.  I felt like a movie star in the surroundings & was happy to find out that the amazing shop below actually sold some of the items that are featured in the living space. It is located on an active street on the 3rd floor of a recently enovated building.  Rob is extremely responsive and a caring host.  I look forward to staying there again!",1.0

Very clean and in a great location. 10/10 would recommend!",1.0
Chicago,"This was our first AirBNB and I gave 5 stars all the way through. Chris was an amazing host. Quick responses and clear communication. Super helpful with us as we learned to navigate city, food and parking. Being from a rural area, we were grateful to have the help! Maps on fridge. Nice residential area, felt safe even at night. Extremely clean. Special touches such as video games and snacks. Went above and beyond to provide a welcoming and safe environment. Room was stylized, modern. Plenty of amenities, even access to laundry. If we make our way back to town, we’ll stay here again. Thank you for making our first AirBNB memorable!",1.0
Chicago,"Great place to stay! Very clean and convenient to food and shops! Reminded me of being Ina little apartment. The shower was a bit small, so if you're a larger person it may be difficult to fit. But it was a very nice place and the host were quick to respond.",1.0
Chicago,My husband and I love coming to Christopher’s place! Traveling to a larger city can be intimidating at times but Christopher is very knowledgeable about the area and has some general directions and maps ready for the guest. We will definitely be back to visit.,1.0

The decor is fantastic and we loved many of the little touches including the board games, tasteful art, game systems, and the water and drinks in the fridge were a welcome surprise after our evening arrival. Having central heat as well as a space heater in the unit helped make sure we stayed nice and toasty during our visit. We didn't take advantage of them, but the fact that a washer and dryer were available was a nice bonus.   We'll definitely look here first on our next trip to Chicago!",1.0

He has snacks and beverages in the fridge. there is also a full kitchen for those wishing to stay long term.,1.0
Chicago,"What a gem! Christopher’s place was exactly as described including a ton of extras. Christopher was quick to respond before and during my stay. He left a light on for me the night I arrived since I had a super late flight. He even checked in on me the next day to make sure I had everything I needed. The place was totally spotless. The bed was very comfy and there were tons of extra pillows. The kitchen was fully equipped and he even stocked it with several quick food items. These were much appreciated especially the first morning. The space felt so much more roomy than I was expecting. Ceilings are a bit lower being a garden unit but I had no problem at all with it. The water pressure in the shower was really great. Christopher made a really detailed welcome guide with lots of great info abt the neighborhood. The studio is only 3 short blocks away from a bus that takes you directly to the belmont el station (abt a 20-30 min ride). I felt very safe in the neighborhood (family vibe) even when coming in using transit late at night by myself. If you are wanting to do a lot of things in the Loop, transit took me 45-hour sometimes depending on the time of day. This was not a big deal for me bc I wanted a neighborhood experience vs more of a downtown touristy one, but it did take longer to get to and from. Lastly, Christopher was kind enough to  hold my luggage for me on my last day since I had a later flight. All in all, fantastic experience and I highly recommend this listing. Thank you so much, Christopher!",1.0
Chicago,Christopher’s place was was everything I could have hoped for. It was a nice cozy place where my girlfriend and I felt immediately at home. Everything was spotless and even had fruits and sparkling water. Christopher is an amazing host and I would definitely stay there again and recommend to anyone! Thanks again for everything Christopher,1.0
Chicago,This is such a great place to stay! Awesome location between the airport and downtown. Uber’s were always there within 5 minutes and were reasonably priced for a ride to anywhere in the city. We really appreciated the snacks and food prep materials that were there and having the ability to make our own food when away from home. Chris was very responsive and was flexible with check in/check out times in relation to our flights. The accommodations were more than we were expecting! Highly recommend!,1.0
Chicago,"I would highly recommend staying at Christopher's place. It is clean, the bed was super comfy and had a lot of pillows. The space has everything you need and he provides a detailed map of parking in the area (so helpful)!  He is great at communicating and always responded right away. The neighborhood is also really nice and quite. I would definitely stay again.",1.0
Chicago,"The house was so accommodating and goes above and beyond most Airbnb places. Quick drive from O’Hare, my uber ride was $25. Plenty of shops and restaurants in walking distance and seemed like a nice, safe and quiet neighborhood.   The communication was perfect with quick replies about anything. Above and beyond amenities, plenty of towels, pillows, even snacks and basic kitchen supplies!   I would be so happy to stay here again.",1.0
Chicago,Christopher’s place was exactly what we needed for our three-night stay in Chicago for Riot Fest. The basement studio was clean and Christopher was very responsive. We were able to use the washer and dryer to wash all our dirty clothes the night before we left which was a nice touch. Would definitely stay here again!,1.0
Chicago,"I very much enjoyed Chris and Paul's home. The decor was nice, they had local food suggestions, snacks and drinks, and plenty of towels. Chris was always quick to respond and very helpful. The location was good and within walking distance of many places to eat. It's a quiet neighborhood but easy for an uber to get to and not far at all from nightlife in Logan Square. I would definitely recommend this air bnb.",1.0
Chicago,"Christhopher's and Paul's place are great Host my girlfriend and I could not ask for more. We were delighted by the apples and other goodies the host provide for their guest. The studio is everything and much more a comfortable place can be it was clean, welcoming, and it is located in a safe neighborhood. Transportation was nearby and made our rides to the city very convinient, also we got to explore more of it by using transportation. Chris and Paul were very effective communicators they responded within a few minutes of us sending a message. We will definetely book again  when we go back to visit our family in the Chicago area. Thanks again Chris and Paul!!!",1.0
Chicago,"We found this to be a much better alternative to expensive hotels. This apartment was private, quiet, and clean. Parking on the street was easy. Chris was very helpful and communicative. The water in the fridge was appreciated! We only stayed one night, but this place has everything you'd need for an extended stay. ",1.0
Chicago,Chris was an amazing host.  His place was very clean and better than we expected.  This was the wife’s first time visiting Chicago and she wasn’t disappointed as this place offers a lot of space for two guests.  Parking on the same street was hit and miss but that can be expected for a big city.  We took Lyft anytime we were visiting downtown Chicago.  It was nice to come and go as we pleased.  Chris responded very quickly to any messages that were sent.  I felt safe enough walking in the general neighborhood.  When we visit Chicago again this would definitely be the first choice.  Our first host cancelled which brought us to finding this gem.,1.0
Chicago,Could not have asked for a better space and location.  Outstanding customer service and friendliness from Chris.  Plus the money we spent even with Uber was less than half the cost of a hotel.  If I could give more than 5 stars I would.,1.0
Chicago,"Chris was a great host.  Nice touches like beverages and snacks in the fridge, full compliment of toiletries, etc.  Bed was firm and super comfortable for a convertible type sofa.  Not at all like a typical pull out bed.  I slept great.  Parking on the street was not a problem and the neighborhood felt super safe.  His place is a couple of miles from my daughter and definitely more convenient, comfortable, and affordable than any nearby hotel.",1.0
Chicago,"Christopher's place is great! It was very clean and comfortable. Check in was easy and Christopher was very easy to get in touch with.

Chicago,"Chris was very accommodating and went above and beyond. There were some basic foods in the fridge, fruit, eggs, soda, and pancake mix. He also held our bags for us on our last day and let us pick them up one the way out. Very nice guy and was always on top of things.",1.0
Chicago,"I can't give Christopher enough praise! This was absolutely perfect for our first trip to Chicago and the basement studio was just wonderful! Not only was it incredibly clean, stocked with snacks and home-y touches, but it was very comfortable and Christopher was an amazing host. He was very open to helping us with our bags when we were a little early to check in and he held them for us so we could go explore the city and enjoy our visit. He was great at communicating with us in a professional and timely manner, and his place was extremely clean and organized. We really made the right decision by staying here! We hope to come back to the area and we will be looking to stay here again! I would recommend to anyone coming to the area! ",1.0

My husband and I were in town to sight-see and were on the move most of the time but we were so thankful to have such convenient and comfortable accommodations at the end of a long day.

The space was well appointed, very comfortable and squeaky clean. We would absolutely stay there again!",1.0
Chicago,"Christopher’s place was everything we expected and more! It was just as it’s shown in the photos but better.

I’ll definitely be coming back!",1.0

I would definitely recommend them to anyone trying to stay in Chicago!",1.0

Chicago,"Now that I have been there, I can totally understand why he is awarded as a super host. Even though the apartment is far away from downtown (45’-1h aprox), it is totally worth it. I highly recommend it. You will feel like being at home :)",1.0
Chicago,"Chris' place is really lovely! Plenty of space for 2 people, with lots of thoughtful touches like biscuits, bottled water, tea and coffee etc! The kitchen was well equipped to make meals, and Chris quickly provided a can opener when we asked to borrow one. The washer and dryer in the apartment were also very handy. Good location in a residential neighbourhood, about 10-15 min walk to the local Aldi and 10 mins to shops, including the currency exchange to get bus tickets. 5 mins walk from the bus stop that takes you to the blue line, which then takes you to O'hare airport or downtown. It takes around an hour to get to the Museum campus, and about 45 mins to attractions like the Skydeck and Hancock Tower. Chris recommended an architecture boat tour which was fab. Communication was always fast and helpful, would definitely recommend!",1.0

Chicago,"Samantha’s place was perfect for our short stay! It was very clean, stylish and cozy. The small, secluded patio was a sweet surprise. Only things to note- the stairs are very steep and the neighbors have a puppy, which was loud when we came in after a concert during quiet hours. Check in instructions were thorough and easy! We would love to stay again.",1.0
Chicago,"Samantha's apartment was clean, cozy, and had great lighting. She was kind enough to let us store our luggage when we arrived early.

Chicago,"Samantha’s place is modern cute chic. Every piece of furniture is well thought out with aesthetic and function in mind. The steps to the loft bedroom: first, it’s very roomy up there and cozy. The steps itself could be problematic for people who are afraid of heights but for someone like me who is uncoordinated, it was surprisingly easy to navigate. Although, I didn’t need anything, Samantha made me feel like she was only an email/text/phone call away if I needed assistance or info. Also, there’s a small but very cute balcony where u can enjoy your morning coffee.",1.0
Chicago,Fun spot to serve as base camp to explore Chicago as you can reach a bunch of fun neighborhoods inside of 30 min. The unit itself was extremely clean and Samantha was super responsive. The lock box makes check in and out simple. Added touches like the full kitchen and French press are a bonus. ,1.0
Chicago,"I had a great stay at Samantha's. The space was lovely and very clean. I didnt spend much time here because I like to explore when I visit a new place, but I appreciated the relaxing and simple vibe of the space at the end of a long day. Samantha and I communicated via text and I found her to be very kind and accommodating regarding a specific inquiry that I had. If you're looking and this place is free, book it now!",1.0
Chicago,"Samantha's place was the perfect place to explore logan square, we used to live in the city and hadn't done much exploring there.

We got awesome suggestions on places to eat and drink and it doesn't take too long to get into the city. 10/10 would recommend!!",1.0
Chicago,"Samantha & Jonathan's loft was exactly as pictured, and located in a convenient location. I loved the apartment - I would love to live here myself! The stairs to the loft was quite steep as others describe, and I left my suitcase downstairs and only went upstairs to sleep. The bed was very comfortable. My friend whom I stayed with wanted an easy access to the bathroom during night, so she decided to use the air mattress downstairs, which we found in the closet (we moved furnitures around to make space). The walk to the California CTA station was 15-20 min for me, but since it was quite a cold week, I often opted for Uber. As we had packed plans in downtown, we did not get to explore much of the neighborhood nor get to ask for neighborhood tips that Samantha was happy to share, but I'd love to come back to this loft and explore more!",1.0
Chicago,"The loft is located in a great quiet spot that is walking distance from great restaurants and bars. It was a ~15 minute walk from both the Logan Square and California blue line stops, and extremely close to tons and tons of good restaurants and bars (check out Lula, Giant, and Longman & Eagle). Samantha was a great host and the place was spotless when we arrived, with tea and some nice snacks sitting on the table. Checking in and out was as easy and quick as it gets, and we appreciated Samantha periodically messaging us to check on our experience. We would stay here again in a heartbeat. Our only warning is that all the stairs in the building are extremely steep and narrow. We didn't have any problems, but you should be careful. Overall a 5/5 experience.",1.0
Chicago,"The space is exactly as pictured.  Simple, basic, perfect for one or two people.  The bed in the loft was comfortable and the HDTV had plenty of premium channels.  The neighborhood is quiet and we felt safe.  Parking on the street wasn't an issue for us, but it did seem to be full in the evening.  Major bus line is 3 blocks away that will take you straight to the northside Fullerton train stops and the Blue Line station that goes to the loop is about 8 blocks away.  The host is easily reached and communication was great.  Thanks!",1.0
Chicago,"I enjoyed my stay in this space! The studio itself was very clean and quiet during sleeping hours. The staircase to the bed was a little steeper than I had expected, but it was sturdy and I got used to it. It was in a lovely location that had access to buses and trains. I did do a bit of walking, but that was my choice. Samantha and Jonathan were quick with communication and gave suggestions for the area. I would stay again. Thanks!",1.0

Chicago,"Samantha's place is absolutely marvelous! It's located in a nice residential area, with some fun bars and restaurants in the neighborhood. If you don't want to wait for a bus, it's a bit of a walk to the blue line, but nothing bad. Uber rides into the city were not that expensive and an easy way to get into the city. The apartment itself is really, really nice. Clean, spacious and an extremely comfy bed. I would highly recommend it to anybody!",1.0
Chicago,A very stylish flat with lots of complimentary toiletries and helpful guide books for the area. The flat isn’t in the city centre but taking an Uber carpool is a cheap and easy way of getting into the main part.,1.0
Chicago,This is a beautifully-designed loft apartment in an upmarket part of town.  It is sparkling clean and has some nice touches such as local coffee. Communication with Samantha was very smooth and she answered our questions quickly.  I would highly recommend staying here in Chicago.,1.0
Chicago,"Lovely apartment in a great area of the city.  Local amenities were perfect (I'd recommend Tony's for any grocery requirement and Wyler Road for a chilled drink and a bit to eat!) and not too far from the ""L"" to the Loop where it's a 20 min ride in.   Hosts were great and very responsive to any request and requirement we had and helped out as much as possible.  The stairs up to the mezzanine are definitely steep but we expected this from the description so not a problem at all and the apartment is carefully thought out to give maximum usability of the space.  Overall a fantastic expperience of this amazing city.",1.0

The apartment is spacious and has everything you need including cooking facilities, big comfortable bed, tv etc. We were a bit delayed and arrived late in the evening, but Samantha was extremely kind by helping us ordering pizza while we were absolutely wrecked from traveling. Furthermore, she always responded very quickly to questions from us. We ran in to her husband Jonathan a couple of times who was also super friendly and gave us a ton of advice on what to do in the city. Overall we had a great couple of days in Chicago and we definitely recommend this place! ",1.0

In walking distance from Logan square, with nice coffee bars, restaurants, shops and street art. But also in walking distance from public transport that takes you to downtown in just a few stops. We would definitely recommend this place for a great visit to this great city",1.0
Chicago,"Lovely loft studio, spotlessly clean and very well designed with everything we needed. Location is good with the metro about 15 mins walk away then 20 mins to downtown, and a Chicago bike scheme station 5mins away and an even quicker cycle to downtown. We also enjoyed the 606 trail, Chicago's answer to the Highline which is also close by.  So a great place and a great location.",1.0
Chicago,Beautiful apartment in quite neighborhood. The space is great it's location relative to public transit is awesome. Samantha was quick to respond to any questions. I will definitely be checking availability next time I'm back in Chicago.,1.0
Chicago,"We had a great stay at Logan Square. The appartment was spacious (more so than we expected) and very clean with thoughtful provisions provided.   Samantha and Jonathon provided us with a great list of nearby places do eat and drink (from fresh coffee to pizza) and were very helpful in communicating when we asked for help.   Logan Sqaure itself is a lovely leafy neighbourhood around half an hr from Downtown on the train. There's plenty of amenities a short walk from the appartment, as well as loads of great bars. A taxi into Downtown is quicker but more expensive.   The 'L' (elevated train) is a 15-20 min walk from the appt and then a further 15 min or so ride into downtown where there is plenty to do. A weekly ticket for the train is around $30 and gives you access to trains and buses. Very handy for getting around as the bus and L system is easy to use.  On a clear day, we would recommend hiring a bike and taking the Lake Shore route which runs alongside Lake Michigan. You get stunning views of the iconic skyscrapers from across the water.  Hancock Tower on a clear day is also a must see too, with great views for miles.  If the weather is cooler, then there are loads of great museums to visit. the History of Chicago by Lincoln Park is great. The Old Town is nearby for a drink afterwards too.  Definitely a great city to visit with lots to do, and a great appartment in a great neighbourhood. 10/10  Thanks",1.0
Chicago,"The apartment was lovely, clean, and the coffee/snacks were appreciated. The security within the apartment was great, and although the surrounding area was less confidence-inspiring, she had us send a photo of our car once we arrived, and the area had cameras, so it put me at ease. We were super close to both bus and train options that we utilized several times, and within walking distance of target for quick pick-ups. We enjoyed our stay!",1.0
Chicago,"Kay is the best superhost you will ever have!! She is great with communication and is very welcoming! Her apartment has a home-like feeling that will make your vacation even better. Cleanest place ever!! Absolutely spotless and smells amazing!!  If you are looking for suggestions of where to eat and shop, Kay will give you a list of her favorite places and provides a variety brochures, pamphlets, flyers, and food menu’s! I had mentioned my family was vegan and she gave me options of food choices around the area!  Great location!!! I highly recommend staying at Kay’s place if you are visiting Chicago!!",1.0
Chicago,"Kay’s place was very cute and clean!! She was super quick to respond to anything. The train is a quick walk from the apartment though I don’t think I would personally feel safe walking from the train tooo late at night as a young lady. Loved how she  had treats available like bananas, it’s, orange juice, coffee. It is very convenient for a quick trip to downtown Chicago!",1.0
Chicago,"Even though Kay's place was more on the south side of Chicago and I was going to the north side for a Cubs game, her place was great for a one-night stay with how reasonably priced it was right before Memorial Day weekend. I just got ubers to get to and from the game rather than public transit. Kay's place was very comfortable and she was a great host!",1.0
Chicago,"Kay’s place was amazing! Such thoughtful, kind touches, and Kay is super communicative. Seriously, this room was nicer and more well-equipped than some of the luxury hotel’s I’ve stayed at. 100% would stay here again!",1.0
Chicago,"From the extreme cleanliness of the apartment to the added extras everywhere you turn, this place was absolutely perfect! The host is respectful and generous with the most friendly senior kitty ever! Coming “home” to a snuggly feline in the living room was probably the best thing ever (I’m an extreme cat person). However, if you’re not into cats, no worries; the cat isn’t pushy and you could probably spend your entire trip ~not~ seeing him if that’s more your style. The off-street parking was clean and safe, something that can be hard to secure in Chicago. The apartment is located very close to both the train and the bus, making in-city traveling quite easy. I would highly recommend this AirBnB!",1.0
Chicago,It’s a wonderful and comfortable place to stay. Kay is really great at communicating with guests and is super nice and welcoming. The space is very clean and has a nice charm to it. We only stayed for one night but I definitely will keep this place in mind if I ever make it up to Chicago again.,1.0
Chicago,I extremely enjoyed my stay at Kay's place.  The location is perfect. My favorite part was having a Target with a Starbucks and market near by. This place is also closely located to a CTA and the freeway entrance if you have a car.  Kay provides many good ameneties and I was very happy for that. She is quickly responsive and super helpful. I'm glad I got to meet her. She is a sweet person.  It is 15 min away from the city.    Also if you have a rental/car there is parking near by!!!  Thanks Kay,1.0
Chicago,"Five stars isn’t enough! Kay made me feel very welcome and comfortable. I felt as if I was staying with family or an old friend, definitely not a stranger. She provided breakfast and coffee for me before I headed out and it definitely gave me a great start. I have a cat at my place, so their friendly lil guy made me feel even more at home. I would definitely recommend her to anyone else and will definitely stay with her again if the opportunity arises.",1.0
Chicago,"I was pleasantly surprised by how amazing the experience turned out to be at Kay's home. The entire house felt inviting and immediately puts you at ease. She puts the guest first and it shows in her thoughtful approach to outfitting the room. From soft bath towels and a loofah at your bedside, to the coffee and tea bar in the kitchen for hot drinks in the morning. She really wants you to feel like you are taken care of the moment you walk in the door.

If it isn't obvious already,  I highly recommend staying with Kay during your trip to Chicago!",1.0
Chicago,"I stayed at Kay's place with two of my friends over St. Pat's weekend. The free parking was a huge blessing, and the apartment was very close to the CTA for local travel. The apartment itself was clean and well-kept. Kay was a wonderful host! From giving us travel recommendations to providing some St. Patrick's day accessories, she made our stay as enjoyable as possible.

Chicago,Kay is an Amazing host with an air bnb that makes you feel at home! The entire house is sparkling clean and full of creative and cute decor.

Chicago,"Kay is an absolute pro of a host.  She communicated check-in instructions very clearly and regularly  touched-base to make sure I had everything I needed during my stay.  Her place is ideally situated a mere 5 minute walk from an L train station (which is a fantastic way to get around Chicago as I discovered).  Very comfortable, clean, and safe place to spend your nights when visiting Chicago-- can't recommend enough.",1.0
Chicago,"The misfortune of staying at Kay's is that one will quickly realize that not every host will be like her! :-/ I was able to take the train (as she pre-stay suggested) directly out of midway and walk about 2 blocks & if cleanliness is next to godliness, then trust Kay has you covered. And to be completely honest, Kay extended herself to me in an act that goes way beyond the scope of AirBnb. I was comfortable, I felt safe, the room was very dedicated. Being that she was my 1st AirBnb experience,  I really feel like I lucked up. Omg, and her snack bar (fresh yummies), were too delish! :-* #BookHer",1.0

There are good restaurants within an easy walk, and tons of stuff within a 10 minute drive.  The L train was very quick to get to and the walk felt totally safe. The apartment is not very close to all the tourist attractions, but the train ride was pretty quick and we really enjoyed being in a neighborhood where people actually live.  We would definitely stay here again!",1.0

Chicago,"I’ve stayed at several Airbnb spots throughout Chicago over the past year for work travel, and this was easily one of the best. The space is incredibly charming with very thoughtful touches, it’s minutes from the Blue line, and in one of the best neighborhoods in the city for great food.  If you want explore the Logan Square neighborhood or just want a nice place with easy access to downtown, I’d definitely recommend staying here.",1.0
Chicago,"This has got to be in the top two best airbnb experiences I've had. Danielle's place is so cozy and looks amazing. We ended up spending a lazy Sunday lounging inside by the fireplace and watching dumb movies - an ideal way to spend a day after heavy touristing Friday and Saturday. She was incredibly accommodating throughout our stay with complications our party had with check in and check out. The surrounding area had an incredible pizza place, a bar where we got boozy ice cream floats, some breweries, and way more that we didn't have time to discover because we didn't want to leave the fire. Will 100% look to stay here again in the future!",1.0

Checking in was effortless with good instructions. Location is good, easy access from the airport and to the city with the CTA blue line. Logan Square neighborhood, while still a bit rough around the edges, is very interesting. Lots of good eateries, galleries and shops. You have to check out Lula Cafe.",1.0
Chicago,"Stayed a wintery week in Danielle's cozy space. The apartment was exactly as published and proved to be a nice base for exploring Chicago.

Chicago,This was a truly desperate search for a safe place for my daughter to stay last minute while out of town.  She made last minute plans to travel to Chicago for the Gold Cup soccer match.  Once there she could not find a hotel to rent to her because she is 18.  She was in her car crying.  I booked with Jim on the internet and spoke with him by phone.  He was so great!!!  He met her and her boyfriend at the door.  He even spoke Spanish with her boyfriend which made him feel great.  He assured me by phone about how safe the neighborhood  was and that he would be on the premises just a moments notice away.  He treated them like adults but still helped me feel comfortable about their safety knowing they will always be my babies.  It was truly above and beyond.  And my daughter said the apartment was gorgeous.,1.0

The modern touch to the retro atmosphere made the apartment feel both cozy and familiar. We weren't bothered by any noise in the neighborhood neither during the day nor through the night.

Chicago,"This place is lovely. It’s a very clean and well restored apartment.  The windows are about at ground level, so actually the floor of the apartment is 2-3’ below ground level.  We liked this, it felt cozy and being on the ground floor was very convenient. The design of the kitchen and living room is very nice, the bedrooms are comfortable and private. Took a few baths, nice bathroom. It was very quiet, almost no street noise. Just a few blocks from Clark street and a few more to the train. We loved staying here!",1.0

Chicago,"Jim & Maximo’s apartment is beautiful & well located. This was our 3rd visit to Chicago for a girls weekend; first time in Andersonville. Nice quiet neighborhood with Uber/lyft convenience to most city locations in 15-20 min. Apartment is on ground floor, some street noise but overall very quiet. Neighborhood is safe with quick walks to great eating spots. We recommend the little red wolf & mhenry.  Apartment is well furnished with nice appliances & conveniences, great WiFi. Host was attentive, but only needed on day 1: we’re pretty low key. Only recommendation would be additional blankets/ linens for pull out couch in living area.",1.0

I could not have asked for a better experience!",1.0
Chicago,"Our stay in Chicago was great and we really enjoyed staying in Andersonville. It was far enough away to be quiet but only a 12-15 minute walk to the train station, which we didn’t mind at all. The neighborhood felt safe enough to walk in and we liked the local coffee shops and restaurants.   The apartment was nicely decorated and clean. I would just give a heads up that if you’re a light sleeper you can hear the hosts upstairs because it’s an old building. I would never take away a star for this because it’s just a personal thing. My wife is a heavy sleeper and it never bothered her but I had to download a white noise app on my phone to fall asleep.   The hosts were great communicators and asked if we needed anything and how our stay was going. We both enjoyed it and would stay here again!",1.0
Chicago,"Jim's place is just as pictured and described and was a lovely, comfortable, clean and quiet place to stay while I visited family and friends in the Chicago area. The location is halfway between the main city and Evanston, which was perfect for me, and it was very close to some really cool restaurants/bakeries, etc. Had no trouble getting around and found parking on the street each night without trouble. Safe and quiet neighborhood. Jim and Maximo were very attentive and had supplied everything I needed for my stay. Would definitely stay there again.",1.0

Chicago,"Jim's place was FANTASTIC. The place was exactly what we expected it to be from the fabulous photos which were 100% accurate showing off the truly lovely and well decorated apartment. Very clean, well appointed, extra towels and pillows, fantastic magazines for relaxing reading, GREAT map of the local neighborhood in order to find fantastic local shops and places to eat.  You can totally get around on public transit (mostly CTA Bus) from this apartment. Note: the place is a little far from the CTA train stations into downtown. We rented a car and really appreciated the flexibility to get around the city easily and great neighborhood street parking.   The apartment is well appointed with everything you need for your stay. One of the bedrooms is street facing but there is not much traffic so it stayed very quiet at night. Air conditioning for the summer time is a huge plus on muggy hot days!  Andersonville neighborhood is one of my favorite areas of Chicago. It is quaint, full of local  charm, great eats and drinks within walking distance, and a fantastic way to get a feel of what real Chicago is like (and not the fake touristy stuff). Off the beaten path geek thing we did - we drove to and walked through the nearby Rosehill Cemetery Mausoleum. The old original section has a substantial collection of LC Tiffany stained glass windows and walking the completely silent hallways to see the sun shining through these beautiful windows is pretty awesome if you like that sort of thing.  Love Jim's place! Beyond 5 stars! We will hopefully be back to town and rent out his apartment again in the future. ",1.0
Chicago,"Great space to spend a few days. Neighborhood was a few miles north of the downtown area of Chicago. Very quiet but still had the Chicago city feel to it.

It's very close to all the Andersonville shops and restaurants on Clark St. and a short walk to the el stop to go downtown; it's in a lovely, quiet, leafy neighborhood of brownstones. Parking was easy -- there was street parking right outside the apartment; we parked the car when we arrived Friday and didn't need to move it or use it until we left on Sunday. The apartment was very clean and well-appointed, with a great kitchen and nice amenities. Jim was there to give us the keys when we checked in; he and Maximo were available if needed but also gave us space. We'd highly recommend this one!",1.0

This is a great apartment with caring and involved hosts. I recommend staying here unconditionally!",1.0
Chicago,"The apartment was beautiful and very spacious. There are restaurants, grocery stores and pharmacies within walking distance. The neighborhood seemed very safe and we enjoyed walking around even in the cold weather. The Keurig and snack basket were nice touches which we appreciated. The beds were  too firm to be comfortable for me, but my boyfriend was fine with it, so it may be personal preference. Jim and Maximo were very attentive and always ready to help. Please note, the apartment does not have a microwave. Also, there is a policy that you cannot have any guest enter into the apartment (not just for sleeping, but for visiting too) which I misunderstood when booking, but it was not a problem since it was only the two of us. If you're traveling in a group or with family staying in other places, you may want to look for another place if you want them to be able to visit you. Overall our stay was lovely and we would recommend this apartment.",1.0

The little touches, such as welcome beers, pour over coffee, books on Chicago, and available toilet trees (we flew in and only had carry-one) were perfect. We only used the room for sleeping since we spent most of our day and night exploring the city! The weather is Chicago sure is unpredictable and crazy, so make sure you have a jacket or umbrella on stand by! Haha Thank you again for allowing us to stay in your lovely place!",1.0
Chicago,"We loved this place! It has all of the amenities and comfort of a nice hotel and more. The space was stunning, just like the photos. It felt very private which was great. We appreciated all of the books about Chicago and local restaurants. We’ll be back!",1.0
Chicago,This place is exactly as it looks! Super cute with personal touches so you know you’re getting an authentic experience. It’s close enough to the L to make traveling to and from the city accessible! Would for sure stay here again; wish I had more time :),1.0
Chicago,"OMG this place is so fantastic. It's PERFECT. I'm going to stay here again for sure! Great location, excellent host, so stylish and cool. The place also comes with an amazing little booklet to tell you how to use the WiFi and coffeemaker, and how to get around.",1.0
Chicago,"If I had more a sense of self-interest, I would write the  worst review ever so that this amazing space is always available for me when I'm in Chicago. First: it is it's own little building in the city. Wow! It's designed so beautifully, I took tons of photos to inspire my guest house back in CT. Elinor was responsive, accommodating, and super nice. I'm spreading the word to all of my friends who are jazzed staying there. The location is 10-12 minutes from downtown... well worth it for these gorgeous accommodations. BTW: the photos don't really capture the details and inviting sweetness of the place. I'll see you again, Elinor!",1.0
Chicago,"Ellie and Devin's space is charming! It's a well-designed, well-maintained large studio with incredibly thoughtful touches: books about the history of Chicago, more books from Chicago based writers and poets, games, postcards, and even stamps. I was a little nervous the first night with the studio being so close to the street, but I slept like a dream – the bed is comfortable and the studio is airy and bright. The place is exactly as pictured, even better. Ellie and Devin were very responsive and helpful. I would definitely come back and highly recommend staying here.",1.0
Chicago,This place is in the best part of the city! So easy to walk everywhere! It is clean with amazing amenities! The cute little touches! The great bath and shower! The delicious pour-over coffee! I want to stay there again.,1.0
Chicago,Elinor’s apartment is the perfect place for a cozy and stylish stay in Chicago. Everything we could’ve needed was provided and Elinor’s neighborhood recommendations were superb! I would highly recommend this place to anyone wanting to visit Chicago (and to avoid tourist traps)!,1.0
Chicago,"I can’t say it enough- this is THE best Airbnb I’ve ever stayed at and is so cozy! It’s worth every penny! I came to take my boards and it was just perfect for the stay. It’s so stylish, quaint, adorable neighborhood, and the little touches are unlimited! There was wine and beer stocked in the fridge, a cute pour over coffee pot and trader joe beans with a grinder! Basically I’m sad I can’t just move and stay in forever. People always say, “oh I’ll be back” but this is serious, I can’t wait to book again! I have best friends who live in the city and I’d still pay to stay in this awesome space! Airbnb MVP! Don’t hesitate! Book it now!",1.0
Chicago,"What you see on the photos are absolutely accurate and more! Loved the open space, high ceilings and obviously the bath. I've been using Airbnb for most of my travels and this is one of the nicest and most aesthetically pleasing location I have ever stayed at!",1.0
Chicago,"My fiancé and I were in town to celebrate our anniversary weekend. We couldn't have picked a better place to stay. The open layout, soft lighting, and claw foot tub all made it seem like a dream. Thank you so much!",1.0
Chicago,"Ellie was fantastic, super fast responses to my emails. Her place was fantastic, and right in the neighborhood where we needed to be. Hate to say this, but she could easily get more per night given the location and how awesome the space is.   Cheers!",1.0
Chicago,"Great place! Great host! We actually had major delays on our flight out of Chicago and she offered for us to stay another night. We felt loved and cared for. If you want a spot not in the downtown hustle but still in the city enough to Uber for good rates, look no further. Quiet neighborhood. Pictures described the space very accurately. It was the perfect space for a quick getaway to Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"Amazing and beautiful first airbnb experience. The place was decorated very modern and was clean. Both the walk in shower and claw-foot tub were great and the water got very hot. The bed was super comfy! There were plenty of towels, extra sheets, and blankets to use as well. There were also nice personal touches such as food recommendations and stocked beverages in the fridge (water filter, coffee, and some wine). Me and my boyfriend had an amazing time.",1.0
Chicago,"Wonderful place to stay while visiting the windy city of Chicago! Not far from great restaurant, bars, shopping and downtown. The coach house is decorated to perfection in mid-century modern decor and very clean. My husband and I used Uber all weekend and waiting no longer than 2 min. for a pickup at the house.  Highly recommend a stay at this location.",1.0
Chicago,"Great place to stay in Chicago. The space is very functionable and artsy, open and airy- we loved it. Comfy bed, all amenities you would want and then far more are provided. There are even beautiful post cards for you to write home with! Highly recommend it!",1.0
Chicago,Ellie’s place is exactly what you see in the all - no false advertising. It’s very light and open and she maximizes the space greatly. She’s very easy to communicate with. The Damen & Western L stations are close enough walk which we utilized a lot. Would definitely stay here again!,1.0
Chicago,"Gorgeous! I loved staying here. It was in a cool neighborhood and the studio was clean, styled well, and the bathroom was top notch. I want to stay here every time I come back to Chicago. They also have postcards and stamps for your use. Sweet little detail. Thanks so much!",1.0
Chicago,"This is a fantastic place. Super bright, extremely clean, great design, and extremely comfortable. Parking was easy. Check in and check out were super convenient and Elinor was very responsive. Can’t recommend highly enough!",1.0
Chicago,Eleanor's place was fantastic! Every detail was thought of including the courtesy postcards depicting her cat who sits in the window in the house on Artesian Street on the front. I would come back to Chicago just to hang out in this cool Studio for a weekend.,1.0
Chicago,"This is a gem of a space that is a close walk to some great cafes, shopping, and night life. As someone who travels a fair amount, I would say this was one of my favorite stays at an AirBNB. The space itself is very thoughtfully curated. ",1.0
Chicago,"There is a reason so many reviews start with how stylish the place is. That reason is because it is stunning and just as advertised! The level of detail and thought put in to the design is unbelievable.   Location is great, quick walk to the blue line. Check in/out is super easy, and the studio manual made our interactions minimal.   Great place to stay, will absolutely repeat.   Thanks again!",1.0
Chicago,"This place was great. It's worth the price just to swim around in that huge bathtub. Ellie was a great host, and the apartment had everything you could need for a great time in Chicago. I found most places I needed to go (food, cute shops, metro) to be about a ~10 min walk away, which I don't mind because I love to walk, but if you don't consider getting a car. It was really easy to get to downtown using the train. I have no complaints, this was an awesome  place!",1.0
Chicago,"This is such a cute, clean and comfortable space! I could stay here for weeks! Nice little neighborhood. Had initially worried about noise at night, but it did quiet down for a restful evening.  The fresh ground coffee, sodas, beer help to make it comfortable. Nice distance from downtown. Safe to run in the mornings with a park nearby. Love this place!",1.0
Chicago,"Ellie’s studio is absolutely stunning! She goes above & beyond for her guest! There are loads of local nicknacks laying around the studio to indulge into. She has her cabinets stocked with things one might need (ibuprofen, cotton swabs, razors, etc). The neighbor hood is very nice. There are not many of taxi’s in the area, so if you don’t drive one might want to download uber. Definitely worth the stay! Would definitely come back!",1.0
Chicago,"Fantastic stay! The studio was as pristine as pictured. You felt more like you were staying in a hotel than someone's home. Great amenities like shampoo, soft towels and even yoga mats! Would highly recommend,",1.0
Chicago,"Elinor's studio was a magical place, and I could tell as I soon as I stepped up to the door, because care was taken in styling the exterior with little faerie lights that sparkled. I hate to say this, but I can be a bit of snob when it comes aesthetic and decor. I have not one complaint about this studio. I was absolutely blown away. The incredible level of detail and design, even down to the studio's handbook was meticulous and thought out.  What's even more wonderful is the central location to all the haunts in the Bucktown/Wicker Park area. I drove and literally everywhere I went was less than a 10 minutes away. I can't imagine that taking public transportation would take any longer. If you do drive, Elinor provides a parking permit, which gives you the freedom to park anywhere in the vivinity without the fear of getting a ticket.  By far Elinor's place is one of the best spots I've stayed in for Air BnB. If you're looking for something magical and romantic (oh, I forgot to mention there's wonderfully restored claw-foot Victorian bath tub) look no further.",1.0
Chicago,Stayed here while visiting Chicago. The apartment was really clean and cozy and located in a really good location for our trip. We were able to park right out front for our stay and walk everywhere. If you're looking to spend time in the Ukrainian Village i would recommend staying here. Close to the train if ya want to travel other places too.,1.0
Chicago,"The initial observation of the space was of course a stylish space for a reasonable price.  Seeing the space in person is such an enjoyable experience - especially when noticing all the fine details not revealed in the online pics.  It is in those details that raises the level of impression and sets it apart from other spaces.    Elinor and I had minimal contact, but that was because instructions were clear on the check-in and check-out procedures, where to park, and even how to make the coffee - which we were thoroughly confused at first.    I enjoy exploring different places to stay when visiting areas, but I would consider staying here again on my next trip to Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"I enjoyed my stay at Elinor's studio apartment in Wicker Park.  The location was pefect for me.  The studio was quite stylish and had many personal touches, including a studio manual which I found quite helpful and fun.  I really appreciated the 2 bottles of wine and the beer selection in the fridge.  The kitchen was minimal but that was fine with me because I planned to enjoy Chicago's dining scene.  The bed was  very confortable, which was a definite plus.  The heater was somewhat louder than I was expecting, but that is the only concern I had.  I would definitely stay here again.",1.0
Chicago,"This is a great spot. Located near hip Wicker Park and related. Quiet, good access to Metro and very pleasant spot to hang out and do some work too. Hostess was very helpful on restaurants etc . This is a top BnB!!!",1.0
Chicago,"The space is exactly as described. Gorgeous. The bathroom is stylish, clean, and the shower is great. Would love to have a space like that in my own home tbh. They have cute touches throughout the studio, including Where Chefs Eat (I have that at home too!) and Studs Terkel's ""Working"" in the bathroom. The bed was really comfortable and once we figured out how to configure the NEST properly for our purposes, the temperature control was on point. One minor note is that both heat and cool air come out predominantly at the head of the bed, and it could be bothersome to people who are sensitive to dry air. My wife had to turn to the foot of the bed one night because she's super sensitive, but it didn't bother me much. The location was good for me because I don't need to be right downtown and don't mind taking a Lyft everywhere, plus I like to be in ""real"" neighborhoods. Puerto Rican restaurants abound as well as cool street art, if you care to venture around. It's about a twenty minute drive to many downtown area attractions. The hosts were very accommodating to my needs, as I had to cancel one day due to a family emergency. They were very easy to work with throughout. Will definitely look to return here my next stay in Chicago",1.0
Chicago,Elinor's place is close to perfect. Every corner of the space is thoughtfully detailed and styled. It's located very centrally to Logan Square and the Bucktown/Wicker Park area and I enjoyed walking the neighborhood in my downtime. Her communication was clear and extremely quick and I truly cannot say enough about how pleasant my stay was. Highly recommended.,1.0
Chicago,"Before I arrived, I loved the photos and thought the place would be perfect for my stay over New Year's. Walking in, it was somehow even better. From the furniture to the lighting to the tableware, everything in the space is very intentionally curated. I have a feeling the owners are designers; the whole place has a great aesthetic while still being comfortable. One of my favorite places I've stayed so far",1.0
Chicago,"We had a great stay at this charming, stylish studio. Clean digs and thoughtful touches like coffee, beer, and wine were lovely. Location was perfect for getting around town by foot or Lyft, yet the street itself was quiet and residential. Great host communication and simple check in and check out. Would stay again in a heartbeat!",1.0
Chicago,"I love this spot . The layout, decor and vibe are definitely hip. Everything is so easy + the communication with Elinor is on point. The amenities are great . The experience is very hommie , every time you discover little details that make a difference in your stay.   If you’re looking for something local, not loud ,  away from tourists this is definitely a good location.",1.0
Chicago,"Ellie’s place is so so wonderful! Chic, stylish, beautiful location from which you can easily access the trendiest Chicago area, Wicker Park. Ellie responds in mere minutes should you need anything and the keypad entry makes it so easy to come and go as you please, no need for keys! 10/10 would recommend and hope to stay here again! ❤️",1.0
Chicago,"Beautiful decor with so much space! Instructions for checkin were easy to follow. The coffee and extras were great!  Very comfortable bed! The apartment has an urban ambiance. Jeremy provided parking passes and we were able to find parking a block away. Communication was excellent. Jeremy answered any questions I had almost immediately. Neighborhood had a safe feel. We walked to local restaurants close by. One unfortunate thing, which was no fault of our host- when we went to leave, we discoveredthat our catalytic converter was stolen off of our car. I had driven our older SUV since I knew it would be parked for several days. Turns out, these are easiervehicles to get under and cut. I would not hesitate to stay here again.",1.0
Chicago,"This Airbnb is the best! Location and space are the key highlights! Jeremy has great design taste! Close to the train and many restaurants. We would definitely stay here again! If you’re visiting, try the rolled ice cream across the street! We had it twice!",1.0
Chicago,"The apartment was absolutely fantastic and everything was as good as advertised. The entire unit was much more spacious than it appeared in the photos which was a welcomed surprise as I have stayed in several Airbnb's that were smaller than photographed.   You could not ask for a better location, one block from the blue line which made traveling to/from O'Hare and into downtown a breeze. You're also within walking distance to countless top notch restaurants and shops.  Jeremy was a very responsive and accommodating host and he really made us feel taken care of when we had some flight plan changes. I would recommend this apartment to anyone wanting to visit Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"There is much to like about this apartment.  It's spacious, has full amenities, plenty of character, parking is included, and the place is clean.  Wicker Park is growing, has a unique vibe, feels safe, and offers options within walking distance for groceries.  The area also has many choices for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and drinks.  We chose to use the kitchen for breakfast, and the waffle maker was a great perk.  A critical factor in comfort, rest and relaxation is the bed.  While clean, we found the mattress to be uncomfortable.  It currently presents itself as firm and lumpy with indentations and sag from years of use.  Upgrading this one very important item would make this location, apartment, and experience worth renting again.  We enjoyed our stay overall and will keep this as an option in the future.",1.0
Chicago,"Came to Chicago for my cousin's birthday party. It was in my old neighborhood, so I felt very much at home. The place was spacious and exactly how it was described! I briefly meet Jeremy when I arrived, he was extremely nice. Would love to come back here when I visit Chicago again.",1.0
Chicago,"I loved this loft and everything about it.  The location was great - 1.5 blocks from the CTA - we were able to explore the entire city using public transportation.  Check in and check out were a breeze.  Jeremy was kind and offered great suggestions when we met briefly during the stay.  The apartment was spotlessly clean, comfortable, quiet and well appointed.  This was my first visit to Chicago and I would gladly stay here on my next trip.",1.0
Chicago,"We loved this place. It's spacious and very convenient. If you have small children, you may want to know that there is a firehouse nearby, but it did not bother us, we expected city noises. There's a Metro station barely a block away. It's great to have a washer and dryer right in the apartment since we tend to pack very lightly. We greatly appreciated the neighborhood parking stickers Jeremey provided and we easily found parking about 1 block away on a safe, residential street. We'll stay here again next time we're in town.",1.0
Chicago,"This is a large, 1 bedroom apartment within 2 blocks of the blue line. Very convenient! There’s a well equipped full kitchen with a small grocery across the street. Of course there a numerous great restaurants in the area so there’s no need to cook. The apartment was very comfortable and clean. We had plenty of pillows, blankets, towels etc. which was much appreciated.",1.0
Chicago,"This was my very first AirBnB and if all of them are like this one, I'll never stay in a hotel again. Jeremey's communication was excellent from start to finish and his home is so beautiful and immaculate. It is easy to find and right off the blue line. The home had EVERYTHING I needed and then some. He even left me 2 day parking passes for the area which made people coming by easy to park nearby. It is in a very cool neighborhood and as a single woman staying in an area I've never been, I felt very safe. When I visit again, I would definitely stay there again.",1.0
Chicago,Jeremey is a wonderful host and his place is extremely nice. He is quick to respond with any questions and is willing to give recommendations around the city. The place was clean and decorated with care. It has everything you would need during your stay.,1.0
Chicago,"Jeremy's apartment is exactly as advertised - stylish, large, comfortable and spotlessly clean in a very safe, hip neighborhood.  The kitchen has all you would need to fix your own meals.  We, however, opted to take advantage of the multitude of excellent bars, coffee shops and restaurants within very easy walking distance on Division Street and North Milwaukee Avenue (for lovers of high quality Nepalese / Indian food we recommend Cumin on North Milwaukee). Communication with Jeremy was very easy.  If and when we return to this part of Chicago Wicker we would, without hesitation choose to stay in Jeremy's place.",1.0
Chicago,"We were very pleased with the apartment. With an updated modern kitchen and bathroom we had everything we needed to be comfortable. Jeremy was a great host, communicated all details we needed when needed.",1.0
Chicago,Jeremy's place was fantastic! It is really big. Was great to unpack and have space and feel at home. Really close to the blue line. Easy to get anywhere. Felt safe in the neighborhood. Fire station next door but never bothered us or woke us up. Would definitely stay again!,1.0
Chicago,Our stay was great! Jeremey was very responsive when we asked him about accommodating our two dogs during the stay. There was even a small crate provided that we ended up using for the smaller pup. Everything was just as described and the apartment is close to many great restaurants and shops. We'd stay again! :),1.0
Chicago,"Jeremey's place is fantastic -- it's bigger than we were expecting and has a really nice overall feel to it.  It's nicely decorated and has all the amenities you would need.  Jeremey was very quick to respond to messages and helped out if anything at all was needed.  Check-in was simple and the building felt secure.  It's just a couple minutes' walk to the blue line, which brings you right into downtown in about 10 minutes.  Also close to some cool spots on N Milwaukee, like Oiistar, the amazing ramen place.  Super nice experience and we'd definitely stay with Jeremey again!",1.0
Chicago,"This was perfect for our needs.  Everything was as advertised.  It's a beautiful space and the location is great.  (Ashland itself is not too appealing but you're a one-minute walk from blue line, can stroll west on Division or walk up Milwaukee Ave to Bucktown.).  Self-checkin was super easy and we had everything we needed.",1.0
Chicago,"Jeremy was very responsive, answering all questions quickly and thoroughly.  His place was nice and very clean.  My parents stayed at the Air BnB to visit me and were quite pleased.  Being that I own and live in downtown Chicago, I can say that this location fantastic and the price to be a great value.",1.0
Chicago,This place is one of the nicest accommodations I have ever stayed at. Yes the price is expensive compared to a hotel but if you want a solid night's sleep and little slice of home be sure to check out Jeremy's place!,1.0
Chicago,Wonderful place.  We really enjoyed ourselves and relaxed at Jeremey's loft.  Very clean.  We enjoyed being able to watch people on the streets from the loft.  Love the mixture of cultures which we don't get much of back home.  Location was great.  Very quick walk to get to Wicker Park and many great local restaurants as well.  Felt very safe in the neighborhood and at Jeremey's place.  Super nice people.  Jeremey is fantastic at returning messages.  Always a quick reply and we had no problems at all that couldn't be fixed quickly.  Highly recommend Jeremey's loft!,1.0
Chicago,"Jeremey's apartment far exceeded our expectations.  The pictures don't do justice to how beautiful, stylish and very spacious this place is, not to mention comfortable and clean.  Everything was simply perfect.  Every possible amenity to make you feel right at home--we wanted for nothing.  Comfortable bed and couches, beautiful, roomy bathroom with large shower and plenty of hot water, fully stocked kitchen, excellent wi-fi and incredibly easy check-in process. We loved the location, merely 2 short blocks (roughly 3 min) walk to the Blue line on the L/ subway.  So easy to get to the main attractions downtown, but also in a great spot to explore the Wicker Park/ West Town neighborhoods and all the great restaurants and shops.  An excellent Airbnb experience--Thank you, Jeremey!!",1.0
Chicago,We found it exactly as advertised—perhaps even better. Super accommodations in a great location. Jeremey was very accessible and promptly responded to our requests and questions. We look forward to staying there again on our next trip to Chicago.,1.0
Chicago,We LOVED the location. The area seemed very safe and was central to the blue line and a Divvy bike station. (Tip: take the blue line to and from O’hare to save a lot of money on transportation) The apartment was very roomy and we enjoyed having access to a kitchen. Something to note is the TV does not have cable or “smart” access. We ended up buying a firestick so we had something to watch while winding down at the end of our days. Jeremy was quick to respond any time we had questions or needed anything! Thank you for a great stay!,1.0
Chicago,"Better than it looked online, a beautiful space with everything needed and then some. Great location, close to public transportation and wonderful local spots. Jeremy was attentive and helpful with all of my queries. Would stay here whenever I’m in Chicago. Can’t recom enough!",1.0
Chicago,"This is a beautiful unit in a great neighborhood in Chicago.  Jeremy was a great host and was easy to communicate with.  Check-in and check-out were a breeze and the apartment was spotless.  It's on a busy street but there was very little noise.  The blue line is a block away as are Target, CVS and a bunch of great coffee shops and places to eat.  Also super easy to pick up a cab or an Uber/Lyft.  Would recommend this place without hesitation!",1.0
Chicago,Communication was fast and easy and Jeremey was available every step of the way.    Apartment was better than I expected.  Great location and very close to the Blue Line which can get you just about anywhere.     Would absolutely recommend and would stay here again in the future.   ,1.0
Chicago,"This is a spacious apartment and very nicely furnished. The location is just a few minutes walk from the blue line with quick transportation direct to the heart of downtown. Check-in was easy and the host provided a sheet with lots of helpful suggestions for local eating places, of which there are many.  Staying at Jeremey's place for 4 nights provided a very comfortable place to stay for our tired bodies after spending our days exploring Chicago.",1.0

Chicago,"Couldn't have asked for a better place. It was super easy to get to and from both town and O'Hare, with a Blue Line stop only one block away. It was beautiful and cheerful as well. Loved the full kitchen and nice extra-large tub. Jeremey was a lovely host. I wish we could have stayed even longer!",1.0
Chicago,"Great location with convenient transportation. The neighborhood has a cool vibe. As a vinyl record collector, I was excited about being across the street from Dusty Groove and close to Reckless Records. Great overall experience.",1.0
Chicago,"My wife and I spent 2 nights at Jeremey's place. While pictures can often be deceiving, we were pleasantly surprised at how large and open the apartment was in person. It was perfect. Jeremey was traveling in Spain at the time, but he was quick to respond to questions we had the day of and during the trip about things such as checking in and adjusting the nest thermostat. We'd happily stay there again.",1.0
Chicago,Great space in a convenient location—a vibrant neighborhood and just a block from blue line. The apartment has a good vibe and personality and is very clean. Jeremy was attentive and responsive. I’ll go back.,1.0
Chicago,"Jeremey's apartment is really great. It's large and bright in all the right places (and quieter and darker in the bedroom, which is lovely for sleeping), stylishly decorated (without being overdone--the decor fits the urban space perfectly), has a fantastic shower, everything you need for a comfortable stay and is in one of my favorite Chicago neighborhoods, with a bajiggety restaurants, bars, shops, etc. The provided parking passes are super helpful, especially for weekend stays, because parking in this part of the city is no joke (in fact, if you can manage without a car, do, because you won't need it once you're here--everything is walkable, lyft/uber is plentiful and the El train is literally right there.)  If mobility is an issue for you, you should know that you have to walk up a flight of steep, narrow stairs to get to the apartment. Also, it's really in the real city, and real cities generally aren't that quiet, so if you're a super sensitive sleeper who needs deep, dark silence, you'll maybe want to bring ear plugs and/or a sleep mask.   But otherwise, I completely recommend this place. Jeremey is a kind, helpful and responsive host, the apartment is so lovely, and it's a really great value for Chicago, too.",1.0
Chicago,"We enjoyed our stay at Jeremy’s place. It's conveniently located, about 15 minutes to the loop and 20 minutes to Midway airport. Although we got around with Uber, the blue line is just minutes across the street. The apartment is super clean and lovely decorated. Jeremy is very thoughtful with the travel guide and tips. It was great to meet a Cal alumni at Chicago. =) I would recommend this listing to everyone.",1.0
Chicago,"This home was great. Jeremey provided easy check in details and instructions. The location was great because I was close to everything downtown and many shops and stores. I recommend this home and would certainly stay here again. Thanks again, Jeremey!",1.0
Chicago,"Jeremy was easily accessible for any questions via text and he even checked in the second day to make sure everything was okay. The apartment spacious, comfortable and centrally located. Just a few steps to the blue line CTA train, restaurants and shops. The neighborhood is busy so the provided parking permits were a huge plus.",1.0
Chicago,"This space is amazing. Plenty of room, furnishings are great, kitchen has everything you could need, and the shower was perfect after a long day of exploring Chicago in the cold. Jeremey was prompt with responses and great about giving me tips on places to check out. Literally just a few steps away from the Blue Line which made getting around the city super easy. I will definitely be looking to get this place again next time I am in Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"Great place! We stayed there with our 18month during our summer holiday trip, all three of us loved Jeremey’s place. Bigger than expected. Jeremey was very supportive and fast with all kind of questions. We can highly recommend this place, also when you are traveling with small children.",1.0
Chicago,"What a great stay in Chicago!!! Jeremey‘s loft is perfectly situated in one of our favourite areas within Chicago. There are so many things to explore in walking distance: restaurants, shopping, parks, and the great 606 trail. The train („L“, blue line) - which is more or less directly in front of the apartment - connects you directly with downtown as well as with the airport. The apartment is so cool, we would love to live there! Despite the busy street in front of the house the apartments inside is so quiet and we slept like babies. Jeremey is a fantastic host and helped us a lot to find our ways, gave us great recommendations and answered immediately whenever we wrote a message. We will definitely come again!!!",1.0
Chicago,"A very spacious and spotlessly clean apartment, it holds special charm with bare brick walls and wooden floors with plenty of seating and a very large bed with a well equipped dressing room.  The bathroom is great with a very impressive bath for easing away the muscles after a long day of exploring.  We didn’t use the kitchen much apart from making a hot drink as we ate out most of the time but there is a great health food shop just opposite and a food shop just by the subway station.  Although we didn’t get to meet Jeremey his communication with us was superb.",1.0
Chicago,"Jeremy’s place is amazing, not only is it huge, it has everything you need for a comfortable stay, it’s in a great location for getting around town (literally one minute walk from the blue line at Division), and really easy to get to on the blue line from O’hare airport.  Jeremy was a fantastic host, very quick to respond to any queries we had, and was kind enough to let us leave our bags for a couple of hours while we went for brunch before heading back to the airport.  I would highly recommend his apartment to anyone wanting to explore Chicago.",1.0

Chicago,Beautiful apartment thats is decorated to perfection. Its conveniently located (10 min walk to wicker park and 20 min subway to downtown). Jeremy was very accommodating and his local coffee & donut tips were great!,1.0
Chicago,"Rob’s place was beautiful! It looked exactly as advertised. The apartment was spacious & stylishly decorated. Lots of restaurants & bars within walking distance, as well as a grocery store. Rob was super responsive & hospitable. We were not able to check in before 3, but he allowed us to leave our luggage in his store prior to check in & even took it upstairs to the apartment for us! The only downside was that the bedroom can get a little warm, especially on a hot summer day. Other than that, we fully enjoyed our stay. Would definitely stay here again!",1.0
Chicago,"Rob’s Place was beautifully furnished and decorated. It was also only a 3 minute walk from the nearest bus stop which can take you to downtown or any of the metro/L lines - very convenient. The only downside is that there is no air conditioning in the bedroom so it got really hot. It is also on the 3rd floor so that’s something to consider if you don’t like taking the stairs. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and would recommend it!",1.0
Chicago,Rob's place is immaculate! I have never seen an Airbnb so tastefully decorated and cozy. Its in the middle of a bustling restaurant and shopping district but is surprisingly quiet. Rob himself was very responsive and a great host. I would definitely come back here for sure. Make sure you take advantage of the $20/day parking that Rob offers. It was a lifesaver.,1.0
Chicago,"My experience could not have been better. This was the mog immaculate, stylish, modern, and comfortable AirBnB experience I've ever had. The owner has spared no expense, from stainless steel alliances to remodeled bathrooms and showers, to new wood flooring. The temper-pedic bed was heavenly, and the furnishings were modern and comfortable. The attention to detail was unparalleled, from train maps and restaurant guides to Chicago artwork and plenty of cooking utensils and supplies, as well as beauty and hygiene products. I was beyond impressed with the level of care and consideration.   When I return to Chicago in the future, this will be my first choice. Always.",1.0
Chicago,We were In Chicago to see Hamilton and sightsee with our teenaged daughter. We loved this location and neighborhood. It felt safe and there were tons of nearby places to eat or get groceries. The condo itself was extremely clean and was well stocked with necessities. It was spacious and we never felt crowded. Rob was a great host and was very responsive to our questions. It was a plus to have  parking available as we never moved our car until we left Chicago. I would definitely rent from Rob again,1.0
Chicago,"Rob's place is incredibly stylish, supremely located, and overall provides a comfortable, beautiful perch from which to explore the city of Chicago.  As a host, Rob was incredibly hospitable and communicative, and was very helpful in getting me situated for the stay.  I highly recommend the apartment and would definitely stay here again!",1.0
Chicago,"This place is a fantastic stay!  Everything is wonderfully decorated, well thought-out, very clean, and it has an authenticity you can only find in a beautiful historic building.  The location is great as well. It’s a 13 minute drive to downtown Chicago, and 500 feet from the best breakfast place in town “Whisk”. You must go there!  Only thing missing in the Airbnb was coffee, so you may want to bring your own. But they have multiple ways to make it if you do.  Great stay, highly recommend this Airbnb!",1.0
Chicago,My wife and I came in to Chicago for our wedding anniversary and are so glad we chose to stay with Rob.  Probably the best Airbnb experience we’ve had.  He really thinks of everything and we can’t recommend staying here enough.,1.0
Chicago,Rob’ s space is 5 stars & beyond. He has gone the extra steps to make his guests well informed about the neighborhood & totally took care of everything you need to be comfortable away from your home.

Chicago,"By far-this Rob's place is the most STUNNING home my husband and I stayed in. The décor is stylish, modern and pure class. The Holiday decorations made it festive and cozy. I really want those flocked trees!! LOL Absolutely gorgeous. The pictures of this listing does it NO JUSTICE!! Rob is a delight and one of thee most gracious hosts I have encountered. His level of hospitality is unparalleled and he gave us some great suggestions of local eateries in the area. His home is in great proximity to downtown and other neighborhoods. We truly could not be more pleased and dreaded leaving to return back to our home state. However, we will certainly be back and definitely in the process of making plans to book Rob's home again. You will not be disappointed!! Truly his home is a GEM!!!",1.0
Chicago,"The warmest home we've ever been in. Sparkling clean, modern and superb interior design, great location and a very lovely, warm host. Thank you, Rob and we promise to only stay at your place whenever we're in Chicago! An experience to remember!",1.0
Chicago,"This was the cleanest Airbnb we’ve ever stayed in. If you are picky with finding a clean place that actually FEELS clean, this home is for you. You can immediately tell that Rob takes pride in his apartment and everything is so well maintained and stylishly decorated. The bed was a welcomed place for rest after a long day, and we loved how firm the mattress was and how fluffy the pillows were—very comfortable.  The amenities were spot on, the coffeemaker, the gas stove, plenty of dishes and quality cookware to use for making a meal. Not mention, the exceptional decor of the entire apartment! The location was excellent and walkable to numerous local restaurants and bars (a few were literally steps from the apartment door). We loved being on the third floor and always felt super safe. There is some traffic noise that can be heard in the bedroom, but Rob provides earplugs for light sleepers. In truth, we actually enjoyed being lulled to sleep by the sounds of the city and it didn’t bother us at all. The convenience of the grocery store being a 5 minute walk away made buying some pantry and fridge essentials easy. The couch in the living room was super comfy and perfect for relaxing and watching the Thanksgiving Day parade and some Netflix Christmas movies. This was the perfect Airbnb and we were highly impressed (not always easy). 5 stars to Rob for such an amazingly clean, comfortable, stylish, and well thought out home away from home. We’ll be back soon!",1.0
Chicago,"This place is so much nicer in person! And wow the bed was so comfortable we ended up sleeping the first night we got there instead of going out because we got trapped in the bed lol. Communicating with Rob was very easy and his home was supplied with everything!! First aid kit, make up remover wipes you name it lol. The home is in a very quiet and safe neighborhood. Would definitely stay again, one of the nicest places I have ever stayed!",1.0
Chicago,"We had a short but wonderful stay at Rob's place for a weekend trip to Chicago. Communication and check-in were quick and easy, and it was a breeze to get there from the airport on the train and a bus.  The space was spotlessly clean and beautifully furnished, with thoughtful touches that made our stay really comfortable. The location is great too, with a grocery store nearby and lots of good food/drink options as well.  Our only regrets are that we didn't stay here longer to enjoy it more and that we had to catch a Sunday morning flight before we could peruse the beautiful store downstairs some more. We would definitely stay here again, and will happily recommend it to any family and friends who may be looking for a place to stay in Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"Rob’s apartment was exactly what we need for a wonderful stay in Chicago. It was styled beautifully and Rob provided everything we could possibly need- thought of everything!

I will most certainly stay here again.",1.0
Chicago,"This might be my favorite Airbnb stay to date. The apartment so stunning, clean, and comfortable and charming Ukrainian Village with so much to offer, we chose to make fewer trips into the heart of the city to spend more time enjoying and exploring the immediate surroundings both in and out of the apartment. Yoga, restaurants, shops, grocery...everything within walking distance and this little oasis to temporarily call home. Rob couldn’t have been a better host. Will be back for sure!",1.0
Chicago,Rob’s place was amazing. Right in the center of everything. The location was close to many restaurants and bars. It is also a short ride to surrounding neighborhoods and downtown. The place itself was amazing with all the amenities needed for a great stay. Rob was prompt in his communication and was right below if needed. The parking space was a bonus as it is hard to find parking in this neighborhood without a permit.,1.0
Chicago,"Location, atmosphere, beautiful decor, every thought to amenities (even a First Aid Kit!)... you simply can't go wrong with this great condo in Ukrainian Village.  It was a snowy weekend so we especially enjoyed the cabinet full of games!  We were visiting family in Streeterville and getting there was no problem at all.  Rob greeted us when I arrived, and check-out was very simple.  Also, my brother drove over from a neighboring city to meet me, so we appreciated the off-street parking for him and his daughter.  Stay with Rob!  You won't regret it.",1.0
Chicago,"This is a stylish, modern yet comfortable apartment located in a cool part of town with lots of options to dine and a young at heart hip vibe.  I felt like a movie star in the surroundings & was happy to find out that the amazing shop below actually sold some of the items that are featured in the living space. It is located on an active street on the 3rd floor of a recently enovated building.  Rob is extremely responsive and a caring host.  I look forward to staying there again!",1.0

Very clean and in a great location. 10/10 would recommend!",1.0
Chicago,"This was our first AirBNB and I gave 5 stars all the way through. Chris was an amazing host. Quick responses and clear communication. Super helpful with us as we learned to navigate city, food and parking. Being from a rural area, we were grateful to have the help! Maps on fridge. Nice residential area, felt safe even at night. Extremely clean. Special touches such as video games and snacks. Went above and beyond to provide a welcoming and safe environment. Room was stylized, modern. Plenty of amenities, even access to laundry. If we make our way back to town, we’ll stay here again. Thank you for making our first AirBNB memorable!",1.0
Chicago,"Great place to stay! Very clean and convenient to food and shops! Reminded me of being Ina little apartment. The shower was a bit small, so if you're a larger person it may be difficult to fit. But it was a very nice place and the host were quick to respond.",1.0

Chicago,"We absolutely loved our say in Christopher's place. While it is a basement space, it has all the privacy you need including your own entrance. The decor is fantastic and we loved many of the little touches including the board games, tasteful art, game systems, and the water and drinks in the fridge were a welcome surprise after our evening arrival. Having central heat as well as a space heater in the unit helped make sure we stayed nice and toasty during our visit. We didn't take advantage of them, but the fact that a washer and dryer were available was a nice bonus.   We'll definitely look here first on our next trip to Chicago!",1.0

Chicago,"What a gem! Christopher’s place was exactly as described including a ton of extras. Christopher was quick to respond before and during my stay. He left a light on for me the night I arrived since I had a super late flight. He even checked in on me the next day to make sure I had everything I needed. The place was totally spotless. The bed was very comfy and there were tons of extra pillows. The kitchen was fully equipped and he even stocked it with several quick food items. These were much appreciated especially the first morning. The space felt so much more roomy than I was expecting. Ceilings are a bit lower being a garden unit but I had no problem at all with it. The water pressure in the shower was really great. Christopher made a really detailed welcome guide with lots of great info abt the neighborhood. The studio is only 3 short blocks away from a bus that takes you directly to the belmont el station (abt a 20-30 min ride). I felt very safe in the neighborhood (family vibe) even when coming in using transit late at night by myself. If you are wanting to do a lot of things in the Loop, transit took me 45-hour sometimes depending on the time of day. This was not a big deal for me bc I wanted a neighborhood experience vs more of a downtown touristy one, but it did take longer to get to and from. Lastly, Christopher was kind enough to  hold my luggage for me on my last day since I had a later flight. All in all, fantastic experience and I highly recommend this listing. Thank you so much, Christopher!",1.0

Chicago,This is such a great place to stay! Awesome location between the airport and downtown. Uber’s were always there within 5 minutes and were reasonably priced for a ride to anywhere in the city.

Transportation was nearby and made our rides to the city very convinient, also we got to explore more of it by using transportation.

Chicago,Chris was an amazing host.  His place was very clean and better than we expected.  This was the wife’s first time visiting Chicago and she wasn’t disappointed as this place offers a lot of space for two guests.  Parking on the same street was hit and miss but that can be expected for a big city.  We took Lyft anytime we were visiting downtown Chicago.  It was nice to come and go as we pleased.  Chris responded very quickly to any messages that were sent.  I felt safe enough walking in the general neighborhood.  When we visit Chicago again this would definitely be the first choice.  Our first host cancelled which brought us to finding this gem.,1.0

The kitchen was well equipped to make meals, and Chris quickly provided a can opener when we asked to borrow one. The washer and dryer in the apartment were also very handy. Good location in a residential neighbourhood, about 10-15 min walk to the local Aldi and 10 mins to shops, including the currency exchange to get bus tickets. 5 mins walk from the bus stop that takes you to the blue line, which then takes you to O'hare airport or downtown. It takes around an hour to get to the Museum campus, and about 45 mins to attractions like the Skydeck and Hancock Tower. Chris recommended an architecture boat tour which was fab. Communication was always fast and helpful, would definitely recommend!",1.0

Chicago,"Samantha’s place was perfect for our short stay! It was very clean, stylish and cozy. The small, secluded patio was a sweet surprise. Only things to note- the stairs are very steep and the neighbors have a puppy, which was loud when we came in after a concert during quiet hours. Check in instructions were thorough and easy! We would love to stay again.",1.0

We slept comfortably and were within walking distance to a lot of restaurants, bars, and the concert venue we attended. We had a great time and would love to stay there again.",1.0
Chicago,"Samantha’s place is modern cute chic. Every piece of furniture is well thought out with aesthetic and function in mind. The steps to the loft bedroom: first, it’s very roomy up there and cozy. The steps itself could be problematic for people who are afraid of heights but for someone like me who is uncoordinated, it was surprisingly easy to navigate. Although, I didn’t need anything, Samantha made me feel like she was only an email/text/phone call away if I needed assistance or info. Also, there’s a small but very cute balcony where u can enjoy your morning coffee.",1.0
Chicago,Fun spot to serve as base camp to explore Chicago as you can reach a bunch of fun neighborhoods inside of 30 min. The unit itself was extremely clean and Samantha was super responsive. The lock box makes check in and out simple. Added touches like the full kitchen and French press are a bonus. ,1.0
Chicago,"I had a great stay at Samantha's. The space was lovely and very clean. I didnt spend much time here because I like to explore when I visit a new place, but I appreciated the relaxing and simple vibe of the space at the end of a long day. Samantha and I communicated via text and I found her to be very kind and accommodating regarding a specific inquiry that I had. If you're looking and this place is free, book it now!",1.0
Chicago,"Samantha's place was the perfect place to explore logan square, we used to live in the city and hadn't done much exploring there.

We got awesome suggestions on places to eat and drink and it doesn't take too long to get into the city. 10/10 would recommend!!",1.0
Chicago,"Samantha & Jonathan's loft was exactly as pictured, and located in a convenient location. I loved the apartment - I would love to live here myself! The stairs to the loft was quite steep as others describe, and I left my suitcase downstairs and only went upstairs to sleep. The bed was very comfortable. My friend whom I stayed with wanted an easy access to the bathroom during night, so she decided to use the air mattress downstairs, which we found in the closet (we moved furnitures around to make space). The walk to the California CTA station was 15-20 min for me, but since it was quite a cold week, I often opted for Uber. As we had packed plans in downtown, we did not get to explore much of the neighborhood nor get to ask for neighborhood tips that Samantha was happy to share, but I'd love to come back to this loft and explore more!",1.0
Chicago,"The loft is located in a great quiet spot that is walking distance from great restaurants and bars. It was a ~15 minute walk from both the Logan Square and California blue line stops, and extremely close to tons and tons of good restaurants and bars (check out Lula, Giant, and Longman & Eagle). Samantha was a great host and the place was spotless when we arrived, with tea and some nice snacks sitting on the table. Checking in and out was as easy and quick as it gets, and we appreciated Samantha periodically messaging us to check on our experience. We would stay here again in a heartbeat. Our only warning is that all the stairs in the building are extremely steep and narrow. We didn't have any problems, but you should be careful. Overall a 5/5 experience.",1.0
Chicago,"The space is exactly as pictured.  Simple, basic, perfect for one or two people.  The bed in the loft was comfortable and the HDTV had plenty of premium channels.  The neighborhood is quiet and we felt safe.  Parking on the street wasn't an issue for us, but it did seem to be full in the evening.  Major bus line is 3 blocks away that will take you straight to the northside Fullerton train stops and the Blue Line station that goes to the loop is about 8 blocks away.  The host is easily reached and communication was great.  Thanks!",1.0
Chicago,"I enjoyed my stay in this space! The studio itself was very clean and quiet during sleeping hours. The staircase to the bed was a little steeper than I had expected, but it was sturdy and I got used to it. It was in a lovely location that had access to buses and trains. I did do a bit of walking, but that was my choice. Samantha and Jonathan were quick with communication and gave suggestions for the area. I would stay again. Thanks!",1.0

We would definitely stay here again. Thank you!",1.0
Chicago,"Samantha's place is absolutely marvelous! It's located in a nice residential area, with some fun bars and restaurants in the neighborhood. If you don't want to wait for a bus, it's a bit of a walk to the blue line, but nothing bad. Uber rides into the city were not that expensive and an easy way to get into the city. The apartment itself is really, really nice. Clean, spacious and an extremely comfy bed. I would highly recommend it to anybody!",1.0
Chicago,A very stylish flat with lots of complimentary toiletries and helpful guide books for the area. The flat isn’t in the city centre but taking an Uber carpool is a cheap and easy way of getting into the main part.,1.0
Chicago,This is a beautifully-designed loft apartment in an upmarket part of town.  It is sparkling clean and has some nice touches such as local coffee. Communication with Samantha was very smooth and she answered our questions quickly.  I would highly recommend staying here in Chicago.,1.0
Chicago,"Lovely apartment in a great area of the city.  Local amenities were perfect (I'd recommend Tony's for any grocery requirement and Wyler Road for a chilled drink and a bit to eat!) and not too far from the ""L"" to the Loop where it's a 20 min ride in.   Hosts were great and very responsive to any request and requirement we had and helped out as much as possible.  The stairs up to the mezzanine are definitely steep but we expected this from the description so not a problem at all and the apartment is carefully thought out to give maximum usability of the space.  Overall a fantastic expperience of this amazing city.",1.0
Chicago,"Place was amazing! My boyfriend and I absolutely loved our stay here in this loft. Area is very clean and very stylish. All of our questions were answered very fast and accurately. Everything was supplied for us, they even had Q-tips lol. ",1.0
Chicago,"We had an amazing stay at Samantha's place. It is located in a quiet neighborhood within 20min walking distance from the blue line. The apartment is spacious and has everything you need including cooking facilities, big comfortable bed, tv etc. We were a bit delayed and arrived late in the evening, but Samantha was extremely kind by helping us ordering pizza while we were absolutely wrecked from traveling. Furthermore, she always responded very quickly to questions from us. We ran in to her husband Jonathan a couple of times who was also super friendly and gave us a ton of advice on what to do in the city. Overall we had a great couple of days in Chicago and we definitely recommend this place! ",1.0
Chicago,"Samantha's place was perfect for our weekend getaway. Travel around the city was very convenient with transit and biking options very closeby. The space was extremely tidy and comfortable, and our hosts were very accommodating...thanks for a wonderful Chicago experience!",1.0
Chicago,"This apartment is great! The apartment itself is already beautiful and special with its high ceilings, and the location is also very nice. In walking distance from Logan square, with nice coffee bars, restaurants, shops and street art. But also in walking distance from public transport that takes you to downtown in just a few stops. We would definitely recommend this place for a great visit to this great city",1.0
Chicago,"Lovely loft studio, spotlessly clean and very well designed with everything we needed. Location is good with the metro about 15 mins walk away then 20 mins to downtown, and a Chicago bike scheme station 5mins away and an even quicker cycle to downtown. We also enjoyed the 606 trail, Chicago's answer to the Highline which is also close by.  So a great place and a great location.",1.0
Chicago,Beautiful apartment in quite neighborhood. The space is great it's location relative to public transit is awesome. Samantha was quick to respond to any questions. I will definitely be checking availability next time I'm back in Chicago.,1.0
Chicago,"We had a great stay at Logan Square. The appartment was spacious (more so than we expected) and very clean with thoughtful provisions provided.   Samantha and Jonathon provided us with a great list of nearby places do eat and drink (from fresh coffee to pizza) and were very helpful in communicating when we asked for help.   Logan Sqaure itself is a lovely leafy neighbourhood around half an hr from Downtown on the train. There's plenty of amenities a short walk from the appartment, as well as loads of great bars. A taxi into Downtown is quicker but more expensive.   The 'L' (elevated train) is a 15-20 min walk from the appt and then a further 15 min or so ride into downtown where there is plenty to do. A weekly ticket for the train is around $30 and gives you access to trains and buses. Very handy for getting around as the bus and L system is easy to use.  On a clear day, we would recommend hiring a bike and taking the Lake Shore route which runs alongside Lake Michigan. You get stunning views of the iconic skyscrapers from across the water.  Hancock Tower on a clear day is also a must see too, with great views for miles.  If the weather is cooler, then there are loads of great museums to visit. the History of Chicago by Lincoln Park is great. The Old Town is nearby for a drink afterwards too.  Definitely a great city to visit with lots to do, and a great appartment in a great neighbourhood. 10/10  Thanks",1.0
Chicago,"The apartment was lovely, clean, and the coffee/snacks were appreciated. The security within the apartment was great, and although the surrounding area was less confidence-inspiring, she had us send a photo of our car once we arrived, and the area had cameras, so it put me at ease. We were super close to both bus and train options that we utilized several times, and within walking distance of target for quick pick-ups. We enjoyed our stay!",1.0
Chicago,"Kay is the best superhost you will ever have!! She is great with communication and is very welcoming! Her apartment has a home-like feeling that will make your vacation even better. Cleanest place ever!! Absolutely spotless and smells amazing!!  If you are looking for suggestions of where to eat and shop, Kay will give you a list of her favorite places and provides a variety brochures, pamphlets, flyers, and food menu’s! I had mentioned my family was vegan and she gave me options of food choices around the area!  Great location!!! I highly recommend staying at Kay’s place if you are visiting Chicago!!",1.0
Chicago,"Kay’s place was very cute and clean!! She was super quick to respond to anything. The train is a quick walk from the apartment though I don’t think I would personally feel safe walking from the train tooo late at night as a young lady. Loved how she  had treats available like bananas, it’s, orange juice, coffee. It is very convenient for a quick trip to downtown Chicago!",1.0
Chicago,"Even though Kay's place was more on the south side of Chicago and I was going to the north side for a Cubs game, her place was great for a one-night stay with how reasonably priced it was right before Memorial Day weekend. I just got ubers to get to and from the game rather than public transit. Kay's place was very comfortable and she was a great host!",1.0
Chicago,"Kay’s place was amazing! Such thoughtful, kind touches, and Kay is super communicative. Seriously, this room was nicer and more well-equipped than some of the luxury hotel’s I’ve stayed at. 100% would stay here again!",1.0
Chicago,"From the extreme cleanliness of the apartment to the added extras everywhere you turn, this place was absolutely perfect! The host is respectful and generous with the most friendly senior kitty ever! Coming “home” to a snuggly feline in the living room was probably the best thing ever (I’m an extreme cat person). However, if you’re not into cats, no worries; the cat isn’t pushy and you could probably spend your entire trip ~not~ seeing him if that’s more your style. The off-street parking was clean and safe, something that can be hard to secure in Chicago. The apartment is located very close to both the train and the bus, making in-city traveling quite easy. I would highly recommend this AirBnB!",1.0
Chicago,It’s a wonderful and comfortable place to stay. Kay is really great at communicating with guests and is super nice and welcoming. The space is very clean and has a nice charm to it. We only stayed for one night but I definitely will keep this place in mind if I ever make it up to Chicago again.,1.0
Chicago,I extremely enjoyed my stay at Kay's place.  The location is perfect. My favorite part was having a Target with a Starbucks and market near by. This place is also closely located to a CTA and the freeway entrance if you have a car.  Kay provides many good ameneties and I was very happy for that. She is quickly responsive and super helpful. I'm glad I got to meet her. She is a sweet person.  It is 15 min away from the city.    Also if you have a rental/car there is parking near by!!!  Thanks Kay,1.0
Chicago,"Five stars isn’t enough! Kay made me feel very welcome and comfortable. I felt as if I was staying with family or an old friend, definitely not a stranger. She provided breakfast and coffee for me before I headed out and it definitely gave me a great start. I have a cat at my place, so their friendly lil guy made me feel even more at home. I would definitely recommend her to anyone else and will definitely stay with her again if the opportunity arises.",1.0
Chicago,"I was pleasantly surprised by how amazing the experience turned out to be at Kay's home. The entire house felt inviting and immediately puts you at ease. She puts the guest first and it shows in her thoughtful approach to outfitting the room. From soft bath towels and a loofah at your bedside, to the coffee and tea bar in the kitchen for hot drinks in the morning. She really wants you to feel like you are taken care of the moment you walk in the door. The location is convenient with good selection of restaurants in the area to choose from and downtown is a hop and a skip away for those who want to take in the sights. If it isn't obvious already,  I highly recommend staying with Kay during your trip to Chicago!",1.0
Chicago,"I stayed at Kay's place with two of my friends over St. Pat's weekend. The free parking was a huge blessing, and the apartment was very close to the CTA for local travel. The apartment itself was clean and well-kept. Kay was a wonderful host! From giving us travel recommendations to providing some St. Patrick's day accessories, she made our stay as enjoyable as possible. We also enjoyed helping ourselves to the coffee bar and playing with her adorable cat. All of our expectations for our stay were far exceeded and I would gladly stay here again.",1.0

Also, there were loads of local brochures and magazines to browse. Her 16 year old cat Toby is such a love! He was super friendly and sweet. It was raining on the day I was going out to adventure in the city and I Kay was so cool about lending me her umbrella. She’s a kind soul and was so helpful with local tips for eats and getting around. Highly recommend staying at Kay’s!",1.0
Chicago,"Kay provided a great Airbnb! She was prompt in her responses and provided a few extra touches that made our stay very welcoming (water bottles in the room's mini-fridge, clear and prompt communication, breakfast items (although we skipped out on those), well-labeled instructions outside the door on how to get in as well as within the house to make things very clear, etc.)",1.0

Chicago,Kay is an Amazing host with an air bnb that makes you feel at home! The entire house is sparkling clean and full of creative and cute decor. This room is spacious and fully furnished with all the amenities you may need. The check-in/out is simple with thorough instructions. The el (CTA train) is a short 5min walk in a safe neighborhood. This is the second time I’ve stayed here and both times there were other guests yet it was very quiet and comfortable stay and rest. Respect this space as it truly is a gem!,1.0
Chicago,Great stay. Kay’s place was in a great location close to downtown and public transportation. The room and bathroom were very clean and had nice touches.

The apartment and room were cozy and I felt like being at home during my stay, with access to kitchen and living room area. The cat is super friendly too!   Kay as a person was a nice host. She even gave me some medicine upon request, as I was catching some cold from the weather in Chicago.   If I ever come back to Chicago I have a reliable place to stay :)",1.0
Chicago,"Kay is an absolute pro of a host.  She communicated check-in instructions very clearly and regularly  touched-base to make sure I had everything I needed during my stay.  Her place is ideally situated a mere 5 minute walk from an L train station (which is a fantastic way to get around Chicago as I discovered).  Very comfortable, clean, and safe place to spend your nights when visiting Chicago-- can't recommend enough.",1.0
Chicago,"The misfortune of staying at Kay's is that one will quickly realize that not every host will be like her! :-/ I was able to take the train (as she pre-stay suggested) directly out of midway and walk about 2 blocks & if cleanliness is next to godliness, then trust Kay has you covered. And to be completely honest, Kay extended herself to me in an act that goes way beyond the scope of AirBnb. I was comfortable, I felt safe, the room was very dedicated. Being that she was my 1st AirBnb experience,  I really feel like I lucked up. Omg, and her snack bar (fresh yummies), were too delish! :-* #BookHer",1.0
Chicago,"Kay is a fantastic host and I can not recommend her enough. When we contacted her for anything we needed, the response was lightning-fast! She was courteous and made her home warm and inviting for her guests. She really took a burden off our shoulders while planning a last-minute trip to Chicago. If you’re looking for a great experience for a really reasonable price, definitely book with Kay!",1.0
Chicago,"If I could give 6 stars I would. Kay's place was immaculate, cute, comfortable, easy to access — everything you could ask for in an Airbnb. Kay herself is an excellent and hospitable host, helping us out with umbrellas, breakfast, sunscreen, loofas — all the little things that shows she truly cares about making her guests' experience as amazing as possible. She is a gracious and generous person and I would 100% stay at her property again. ",1.0
Chicago,"If you don't like stairs or cats, that is the only reason not to stay here. Location is good, ample parking & light outdoors- ammenities are top & Kay is an awesome host with a BIG heart for her aging cat- that alone should make her 1st choice for any cat lover.",1.0
Chicago,Kay's place was absolutely amazing. She was a perfect host and made my vacation feel so comfortable. I was traveling alone and one late night she even messaged me to make sure I was ok.

Once there she could not find a hotel to rent to her because she is 18.  She was in her car crying.  I booked with Jim on the internet and spoke with him by phone.  He was so great!!!  He met her and her boyfriend at the door.  He even spoke Spanish with her boyfriend which made him feel great.  He assured me by phone about how safe the neighborhood  was and that he would be on the premises just a moments notice away.  He treated them like adults but still helped me feel comfortable about their safety knowing they will always be my babies.  It was truly above and beyond.

Chicago,This is a lovely place if you are looking to have an authentic Chicago neighborhood experience. The apartment is just as it is described by Jim and so you can expect to get what you see here online. That alone is worth a 5 star review! Thanks!,1.0

Chicago,"This place was spacious, clean, and thoughtfully decorated. We used the Keurig to make coffee every morning and Jim and Maximo were great about checking in to see if we needed anything. Just a few blocks away from the Andersonville shops, this place is also in  a great location, and there were several resources in the apartment with local food/shopping suggestions. Could not have asked for a better place to stay! Thank you!",1.0
Chicago,"This place lives up to it's description and preview. Very clean, very comfortable, and quiet and everything you'll need for a stay. Parking was easy, and it was a short walk to restaurants, cafes, and public transit.",1.0
Chicago,"Jim & Maximo’s apartment is beautiful & well located. This was our 3rd visit to Chicago for a girls weekend; first time in Andersonville. Nice quiet neighborhood with Uber/lyft convenience to most city locations in 15-20 min. Apartment is on ground floor, some street noise but overall very quiet. Neighborhood is safe with quick walks to great eating spots. We recommend the little red wolf & mhenry.  Apartment is well furnished with nice appliances & conveniences, great WiFi. Host was attentive, but only needed on day 1: we’re pretty low key. Only recommendation would be additional blankets/ linens for pull out couch in living area.",1.0
Chicago,"From the moment I booked, everything was five stars. I never waited on a reply. I was behind schedule on check in day, nevertheless, Maximo promptly greeted me and I checked in immediately. The place was spotless and it was better than advertised. The nieghborhood was quaint and there was always parking available. I would stay here again and highly recommend it to friends, family, and anyone visiting looking for a clean, updated condo in an awesome Chicago nieghborhood.",1.0
Chicago,"Had a great stay, I️ checked in sooner and they gave me no problem, I️ was greeted as soon as I️ got there and given a welcome and was told they were staying in the same building so I️f I️ needed anything to ask, also gave me background on the neighborhood. The apt is so clean, very stylish and cozy. And the neighborhood is super safe with free parking!! The hosts were friendly and attentive to us. We really enjoyed our stay.",1.0
Chicago,"The location of this property could not be in a better place in Chicago! We felt like we hit the Airbnb Lotto! Such an amazingly diverse, safe clean and welcoming neighborhood! the apartment was beautiful and absolutely spotless I've never seen anything so clean! Jim was amazing! I could not have asked for a better experience!",1.0
Chicago,"Our stay in Chicago was great and we really enjoyed staying in Andersonville. It was far enough away to be quiet but only a 12-15 minute walk to the train station, which we didn’t mind at all. The neighborhood felt safe enough to walk in and we liked the local coffee shops and restaurants.   The apartment was nicely decorated and clean. I would just give a heads up that if you’re a light sleeper you can hear the hosts upstairs because it’s an old building. I would never take away a star for this because it’s just a personal thing. My wife is a heavy sleeper and it never bothered her but I had to download a white noise app on my phone to fall asleep.   The hosts were great communicators and asked if we needed anything and how our stay was going. We both enjoyed it and would stay here again!",1.0
Chicago,"Jim's place is just as pictured and described and was a lovely, comfortable, clean and quiet place to stay while I visited family and friends in the Chicago area. The location is halfway between the main city and Evanston, which was perfect for me, and it was very close to some really cool restaurants/bakeries, etc. Had no trouble getting around and found parking on the street each night without trouble. Safe and quiet neighborhood. Jim and Maximo were very attentive and had supplied everything I needed for my stay. Would definitely stay there again.",1.0
Chicago,This place is as advertised or better. Superhosts and great amenities. Secure neighborhood and a beautiful apartment make this a great place to stay when you’re in Chicago.

Chicago,"Jim's place was FANTASTIC. The place was exactly what we expected it to be from the fabulous photos which were 100% accurate showing off the truly lovely and well decorated apartment. Very clean, well appointed, extra towels and pillows, fantastic magazines for relaxing reading, GREAT map of the local neighborhood in order to find fantastic local shops and places to eat.  You can totally get around on public transit (mostly CTA Bus) from this apartment. Note: the place is a little far from the CTA train stations into downtown. We rented a car and really appreciated the flexibility to get around the city easily and great neighborhood street parking.   The apartment is well appointed with everything you need for your stay. One of the bedrooms is street facing but there is not much traffic so it stayed very quiet at night. Air conditioning for the summer time is a huge plus on muggy hot days!  Andersonville neighborhood is one of my favorite areas of Chicago. It is quaint, full of local  charm, great eats and drinks within walking distance, and a fantastic way to get a feel of what real Chicago is like (and not the fake touristy stuff). Off the beaten path geek thing we did - we drove to and walked through the nearby Rosehill Cemetery Mausoleum. The old original section has a substantial collection of LC Tiffany stained glass windows and walking the completely silent hallways to see the sun shining through these beautiful windows is pretty awesome if you like that sort of thing.  Love Jim's place! Beyond 5 stars! We will hopefully be back to town and rent out his apartment again in the future. ",1.0
Chicago,"Great space to spend a few days. Neighborhood was a few miles north of the downtown area of Chicago. Very quiet but still had the Chicago city feel to it.

So you guys are very nice  and  your hospitality goes beyond  what words can describe .  I know  past experiences  that Airbnb have change my life on how I stay in a city or a place of my travels keep up the good work.  So your place very  amazing  it’s worth every penny that I spend.

Chicago,"The apartment was beautiful with 2 comfortable beds, with the bedrooms on opposite ends of the unit from each other.  A very short walk (few short blocks) from downtown Andersonville with all of it's shops and restaurants, with a farmers market every Wednesday. Beautiful area to walk around. I'd recommend it to anyone looking to stay in the area.",1.0
Chicago,"Jim and Maximo were great hosts! This spacious two-bed, one-bath is the perfect getaway for family and friends! I picked Andersonville, because it's a great LGBTQ+ friendly neighborhood and was a great location to experience all of the Pride festivities happening over the weekend during our stay. Jim and Maximo were super responsive and very accommodating throughout my entire experience even before arriving for the weekend! The neighborhood is a family-friendly area and was very walk-able with lots of places to go for food, coffee or to go grocery shopping. The apartment was very spacious, clean and had lots of cute touches/decorations to make the place feel like home. I will definitely look to stay here again in the future during my next visit to Chicago!",1.0

Chicago,"This place was phenomenal. It was just as pictured, the location is awesome to the city we visited, both hosts handled any/all things we needed/checked up on us, and all of our necessities were met and beyond. This was a very pleasurable stay and I would definitely recommend this place to friends if they ever come visit Chicago.   You have everything you need within a short walk and if you really need to, there’s a Target .7 miles from the place. Close eating and bar spots within a short walk. It takes about 20-30 min to get into Chicago.   Awesome visit and great hosts.",1.0
Chicago,"Jim & Maximo we’re outstanding hosts. Every detail of this beautiful apartment was lovely. The location was great for our stay in north Chicago.

Chicago,"Loved Jim and Maximo’s place, it was very spacious, clean and stylish. I enjoyed looking through the magazines and the beds were extremely comfortable.

Chicago,"Jim’s place was (Website hidden by Airbnb) pictured and described...super cute, spacious, and comfy! Great neighborhood with access to awesome restaurants within walking distance, and easy ~12-15 min walk to red line to get into downtown. Our family also appreciated the local playgrounds and family vibe of the neighborhood. Jim and Maximo were wonderful hosts. They were quick to communicate with us and responsive to our needs. We would definitely stay again upon a return visit to Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"We really enjoyed staying at Jim's place over a quick weekend get-away to Chicago. It's very close to all the Andersonville shops and restaurants on Clark St. and a short walk to the el stop to go downtown; it's in a lovely, quiet, leafy neighborhood of brownstones. Parking was easy -- there was street parking right outside the apartment; we parked the car when we arrived Friday and didn't need to move it or use it until we left on Sunday. The apartment was very clean and well-appointed, with a great kitchen and nice amenities. Jim was there to give us the keys when we checked in; he and Maximo were available if needed but also gave us space. We'd highly recommend this one!",1.0
Chicago,"Stylish apartment in a great location with convenient parking and great restaurants/shops nearby. We really enjoyed our stay here. The kitchen had everything we needed to cook and prepare our own food. Jim was very responsive and accommodating, which made everything easy and enjoyable. I wish that we could have controlled the heat ourselves, but when the apartment started to get a bit chilly, we notified Jim, and he was able to turn on the heat for us quickly. Overall a great space and great experience!",1.0
Chicago,"Jim’s place is aesthetically pleasing, clean, and comfortable. It is in the lovely neighborhood of Andersonville and accessible to many restaurants and shops. I appreciated the clear communication, quick responses, ease of check in, and helpfulness when I needed to extend my stay. The house is well equipped with the conveniences and thoughtful touches that are helpful to a busy business traveler- a high quality iron and real ironing board, a washer and drier, toiletries, coffee etc.I would definitely stay at Jim’s place again.",1.0
Chicago,"We loved staying here! The place was beautiful, with many nice touches, a charming older building but remodelled with modern amenities, and sparkling clean. Getting in was very convenient, there were snacks left there for us to enjoy, parking on the street was easy, and Jim and Maximo always responded immediately to all of our queries, plus checked in to see if we wanted coffee, or needed anything else from them, checked on the comfort of the beds, and generally made sure that we had a great stay and felt well cared for. The kitchen is well appointed - the only thing not available was a microwave, but Maximo commented that he's about to get one for the apartment so that can be expected soon.  This is a great apartment with caring and involved hosts. I recommend staying here unconditionally!",1.0
Chicago,"The apartment was beautiful and very spacious. There are restaurants, grocery stores and pharmacies within walking distance. The neighborhood seemed very safe and we enjoyed walking around even in the cold weather. The Keurig and snack basket were nice touches which we appreciated. The beds were  too firm to be comfortable for me, but my boyfriend was fine with it, so it may be personal preference. Jim and Maximo were very attentive and always ready to help. Please note, the apartment does not have a microwave. Also, there is a policy that you cannot have any guest enter into the apartment (not just for sleeping, but for visiting too) which I misunderstood when booking, but it was not a problem since it was only the two of us. If you're traveling in a group or with family staying in other places, you may want to look for another place if you want them to be able to visit you. Overall our stay was lovely and we would recommend this apartment.",1.0
Chicago,"Location, location, location! The spot is located in a beautiful historic neighbourhood filled with lots of charm, great shops, and fantastic restaurants within walking distance.

Chicago,"This was my second stay at Ellie’s place, and I maintain that it’s one of the best Airbnbs ever! So quiet, clean, stylish, and comfortable. The tub is awesome and the coffee’s great, what more could I ask for?",1.0
Chicago,"Place was great! Clean, cozy, great location. Check in & out went seamlessly. LOVED the bathtub and shower. I would definitely recommend. The TV package was a surprising plus.. not usually one to hang out too much at a bnb- but after a day of drinking at Wrigley we were feeling a little rough-  it was so nice to just chill out the next day watching movies and ordering food! Loved it!",1.0
Chicago,"As a single traveler the studio set up was perfect for me. The location was great, since I had just been staying downtown at a conference prior to my stay it was nice to get out a bit and see some other neighborhoods. I could easily walk to the 606 Trail - which I really enjoyed - and N Milwaukee Ave for some fun shopping. I appreciated the guide they had in the studio with local recommendations listed, I got take-out from the Indian place down the street and it was delicious. Very comfortable bed!",1.0

Chicago,"I absolutely loved this place! I already told my sister that when we get the chance to go to Chicago together we will absolutely have to stay there. It was the perfect size and had everything I needed. The style of the whole place was gorgeous. I can tell a lot of thought went into creating this space. The shower and bathtub were amazing, and it was very helpful that there was a hair dryer, shampoo/conditioner, body wash, etc. When I do get the chance to travel to Chicago again I hope this is available. I can’t say enough about how much I loved this place!",1.0

Chicago,"What can I say except that Elinor’s place was great! The little touches, such as welcome beers, pour over coffee, books on Chicago, and available toilet trees (we flew in and only had carry-one) were perfect. We only used the room for sleeping since we spent most of our day and night exploring the city! The weather is Chicago sure is unpredictable and crazy, so make sure you have a jacket or umbrella on stand by! Haha Thank you again for allowing us to stay in your lovely place!",1.0

Chicago,"If I had more a sense of self-interest, I would write the  worst review ever so that this amazing space is always available for me when I'm in Chicago. First: it is it's own little building in the city. Wow! It's designed so beautifully, I took tons of photos to inspire my guest house back in CT. Elinor was responsive, accommodating, and super nice. I'm spreading the word to all of my friends who are jazzed staying there. The location is 10-12 minutes from downtown... well worth it for these gorgeous accommodations. BTW: the photos don't really capture the details and inviting sweetness of the place. I'll see you again, Elinor!",1.0
Chicago,"Ellie and Devin's space is charming! It's a well-designed, well-maintained large studio with incredibly thoughtful touches: books about the history of Chicago, more books from Chicago based writers and poets, games, postcards, and even stamps. I was a little nervous the first night with the studio being so close to the street, but I slept like a dream – the bed is comfortable and the studio is airy and bright. The place is exactly as pictured, even better. Ellie and Devin were very responsive and helpful. I would definitely come back and highly recommend staying here.",1.0

Chicago,"I can’t say it enough- this is THE best Airbnb I’ve ever stayed at and is so cozy! It’s worth every penny! I came to take my boards and it was just perfect for the stay. It’s so stylish, quaint, adorable neighborhood, and the little touches are unlimited! There was wine and beer stocked in the fridge, a cute pour over coffee pot and trader joe beans with a grinder! Basically I’m sad I can’t just move and stay in forever. People always say, “oh I’ll be back” but this is serious, I can’t wait to book again! I have best friends who live in the city and I’d still pay to stay in this awesome space! Airbnb MVP! Don’t hesitate! Book it now!",1.0

Chicago,"Great place! Great host! We actually had major delays on our flight out of Chicago and she offered for us to stay another night. We felt loved and cared for. If you want a spot not in the downtown hustle but still in the city enough to Uber for good rates, look no further. Quiet neighborhood. Pictures described the space very accurately. It was the perfect space for a quick getaway to Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"Amazing and beautiful first airbnb experience. The place was decorated very modern and was clean. Both the walk in shower and claw-foot tub were great and the water got very hot. The bed was super comfy! There were plenty of towels, extra sheets, and blankets to use as well. There were also nice personal touches such as food recommendations and stocked beverages in the fridge (water filter, coffee, and some wine). Me and my boyfriend had an amazing time.",1.0
Chicago,"Wonderful place to stay while visiting the windy city of Chicago! Not far from great restaurant, bars, shopping and downtown. The coach house is decorated to perfection in mid-century modern decor and very clean. My husband and I used Uber all weekend and waiting no longer than 2 min. for a pickup at the house.  Highly recommend a stay at this location.",1.0
Chicago,"Great place to stay in Chicago. The space is very functionable and artsy, open and airy- we loved it. Comfy bed, all amenities you would want and then far more are provided. There are even beautiful post cards for you to write home with! Highly recommend it!",1.0
Chicago,Ellie’s place is exactly what you see in the all - no false advertising. It’s very light and open and she maximizes the space greatly. She’s very easy to communicate with. The Damen & Western L stations are close enough walk which we utilized a lot. Would definitely stay here again!,1.0
Chicago,"Gorgeous! I loved staying here. It was in a cool neighborhood and the studio was clean, styled well, and the bathroom was top notch. I want to stay here every time I come back to Chicago. They also have postcards and stamps for your use. Sweet little detail. Thanks so much!",1.0

Chicago,"This is a gem of a space that is a close walk to some great cafes, shopping, and night life. As someone who travels a fair amount, I would say this was one of my favorite stays at an AirBNB. The space itself is very thoughtfully curated. ",1.0
Chicago,"There is a reason so many reviews start with how stylish the place is. That reason is because it is stunning and just as advertised! The level of detail and thought put in to the design is unbelievable.   Location is great, quick walk to the blue line. Check in/out is super easy, and the studio manual made our interactions minimal.   Great place to stay, will absolutely repeat.   Thanks again!",1.0
Chicago,"This place was great. It's worth the price just to swim around in that huge bathtub. Ellie was a great host, and the apartment had everything you could need for a great time in Chicago. I found most places I needed to go (food, cute shops, metro) to be about a ~10 min walk away, which I don't mind because I love to walk, but if you don't consider getting a car. It was really easy to get to downtown using the train. I have no complaints, this was an awesome  place!",1.0
Chicago,"This is such a cute, clean and comfortable space! I could stay here for weeks! Nice little neighborhood. Had initially worried about noise at night, but it did quiet down for a restful evening.  The fresh ground coffee, sodas, beer help to make it comfortable. Nice distance from downtown. Safe to run in the mornings with a park nearby. Love this place!",1.0
Chicago,"Ellie’s studio is absolutely stunning! She goes above & beyond for her guest! There are loads of local nicknacks laying around the studio to indulge into. She has her cabinets stocked with things one might need (ibuprofen, cotton swabs, razors, etc). The neighbor hood is very nice. There are not many of taxi’s in the area, so if you don’t drive one might want to download uber. Definitely worth the stay! Would definitely come back!",1.0
Chicago,"Fantastic stay! The studio was as pristine as pictured. You felt more like you were staying in a hotel than someone's home. Great amenities like shampoo, soft towels and even yoga mats! Would highly recommend,",1.0
Chicago,"Elinor's studio was a magical place, and I could tell as I soon as I stepped up to the door, because care was taken in styling the exterior with little faerie lights that sparkled. I hate to say this, but I can be a bit of snob when it comes aesthetic and decor. I have not one complaint about this studio. I was absolutely blown away. The incredible level of detail and design, even down to the studio's handbook was meticulous and thought out.  What's even more wonderful is the central location to all the haunts in the Bucktown/Wicker Park area. I drove and literally everywhere I went was less than a 10 minutes away. I can't imagine that taking public transportation would take any longer. If you do drive, Elinor provides a parking permit, which gives you the freedom to park anywhere in the vivinity without the fear of getting a ticket.  By far Elinor's place is one of the best spots I've stayed in for Air BnB. If you're looking for something magical and romantic (oh, I forgot to mention there's wonderfully restored claw-foot Victorian bath tub) look no further.",1.0
Chicago,Stayed here while visiting Chicago. The apartment was really clean and cozy and located in a really good location for our trip. We were able to park right out front for our stay and walk everywhere. If you're looking to spend time in the Ukrainian Village i would recommend staying here. Close to the train if ya want to travel other places too.,1.0
Chicago,"The initial observation of the space was of course a stylish space for a reasonable price.  Seeing the space in person is such an enjoyable experience - especially when noticing all the fine details not revealed in the online pics.  It is in those details that raises the level of impression and sets it apart from other spaces.    Elinor and I had minimal contact, but that was because instructions were clear on the check-in and check-out procedures, where to park, and even how to make the coffee - which we were thoroughly confused at first.    I enjoy exploring different places to stay when visiting areas, but I would consider staying here again on my next trip to Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"I enjoyed my stay at Elinor's studio apartment in Wicker Park.  The location was pefect for me.  The studio was quite stylish and had many personal touches, including a studio manual which I found quite helpful and fun.  I really appreciated the 2 bottles of wine and the beer selection in the fridge.  The kitchen was minimal but that was fine with me because I planned to enjoy Chicago's dining scene.  The bed was  very confortable, which was a definite plus.  The heater was somewhat louder than I was expecting, but that is the only concern I had.  I would definitely stay here again.",1.0
Chicago,"This is a great spot. Located near hip Wicker Park and related. Quiet, good access to Metro and very pleasant spot to hang out and do some work too. Hostess was very helpful on restaurants etc . This is a top BnB!!!",1.0
Chicago,"The space is exactly as described. Gorgeous. The bathroom is stylish, clean, and the shower is great. Would love to have a space like that in my own home tbh. They have cute touches throughout the studio, including Where Chefs Eat (I have that at home too!) and Studs Terkel's ""Working"" in the bathroom. The bed was really comfortable and once we figured out how to configure the NEST properly for our purposes, the temperature control was on point. One minor note is that both heat and cool air come out predominantly at the head of the bed, and it could be bothersome to people who are sensitive to dry air. My wife had to turn to the foot of the bed one night because she's super sensitive, but it didn't bother me much. The location was good for me because I don't need to be right downtown and don't mind taking a Lyft everywhere, plus I like to be in ""real"" neighborhoods. Puerto Rican restaurants abound as well as cool street art, if you care to venture around. It's about a twenty minute drive to many downtown area attractions. The hosts were very accommodating to my needs, as I had to cancel one day due to a family emergency. They were very easy to work with throughout. Will definitely look to return here my next stay in Chicago",1.0
Chicago,Elinor's place is close to perfect. Every corner of the space is thoughtfully detailed and styled. It's located very centrally to Logan Square and the Bucktown/Wicker Park area and I enjoyed walking the neighborhood in my downtime. Her communication was clear and extremely quick and I truly cannot say enough about how pleasant my stay was. Highly recommended.,1.0
Chicago,"Before I arrived, I loved the photos and thought the place would be perfect for my stay over New Year's. Walking in, it was somehow even better. From the furniture to the lighting to the tableware, everything in the space is very intentionally curated. I have a feeling the owners are designers; the whole place has a great aesthetic while still being comfortable. One of my favorite places I've stayed so far",1.0
Chicago,"We had a great stay at this charming, stylish studio. Clean digs and thoughtful touches like coffee, beer, and wine were lovely. Location was perfect for getting around town by foot or Lyft, yet the street itself was quiet and residential. Great host communication and simple check in and check out. Would stay again in a heartbeat!",1.0
Chicago,"I love this spot . The layout, decor and vibe are definitely hip. Everything is so easy + the communication with Elinor is on point. The amenities are great . The experience is very hommie , every time you discover little details that make a difference in your stay.   If you’re looking for something local, not loud ,  away from tourists this is definitely a good location.",1.0
Chicago,"Ellie’s place is so so wonderful! Chic, stylish, beautiful location from which you can easily access the trendiest Chicago area, Wicker Park. Ellie responds in mere minutes should you need anything and the keypad entry makes it so easy to come and go as you please, no need for keys! 10/10 would recommend and hope to stay here again! ❤️",1.0
Chicago,"Beautiful decor with so much space! Instructions for checkin were easy to follow. The coffee and extras were great!  Very comfortable bed! The apartment has an urban ambiance. Jeremy provided parking passes and we were able to find parking a block away. Communication was excellent. Jeremy answered any questions I had almost immediately. Neighborhood had a safe feel. We walked to local restaurants close by. One unfortunate thing, which was no fault of our host- when we went to leave, we discoveredthat our catalytic converter was stolen off of our car. I had driven our older SUV since I knew it would be parked for several days. Turns out, these are easiervehicles to get under and cut. I would not hesitate to stay here again.",1.0
Chicago,"This Airbnb is the best! Location and space are the key highlights! Jeremy has great design taste! Close to the train and many restaurants. We would definitely stay here again! If you’re visiting, try the rolled ice cream across the street! We had it twice!",1.0
Chicago,"The apartment was absolutely fantastic and everything was as good as advertised. The entire unit was much more spacious than it appeared in the photos which was a welcomed surprise as I have stayed in several Airbnb's that were smaller than photographed.   You could not ask for a better location, one block from the blue line which made traveling to/from O'Hare and into downtown a breeze. You're also within walking distance to countless top notch restaurants and shops.  Jeremy was a very responsive and accommodating host and he really made us feel taken care of when we had some flight plan changes. I would recommend this apartment to anyone wanting to visit Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"There is much to like about this apartment.  It's spacious, has full amenities, plenty of character, parking is included, and the place is clean.  Wicker Park is growing, has a unique vibe, feels safe, and offers options within walking distance for groceries.  The area also has many choices for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and drinks.  We chose to use the kitchen for breakfast, and the waffle maker was a great perk.  A critical factor in comfort, rest and relaxation is the bed.  While clean, we found the mattress to be uncomfortable.  It currently presents itself as firm and lumpy with indentations and sag from years of use.  Upgrading this one very important item would make this location, apartment, and experience worth renting again.  We enjoyed our stay overall and will keep this as an option in the future.",1.0
Chicago,"Came to Chicago for my cousin's birthday party. It was in my old neighborhood, so I felt very much at home. The place was spacious and exactly how it was described! I briefly meet Jeremy when I arrived, he was extremely nice. Would love to come back here when I visit Chicago again.",1.0
Chicago,"I loved this loft and everything about it.  The location was great - 1.5 blocks from the CTA - we were able to explore the entire city using public transportation.  Check in and check out were a breeze.  Jeremy was kind and offered great suggestions when we met briefly during the stay.  The apartment was spotlessly clean, comfortable, quiet and well appointed.  This was my first visit to Chicago and I would gladly stay here on my next trip.",1.0
Chicago,"We loved this place. It's spacious and very convenient. If you have small children, you may want to know that there is a firehouse nearby, but it did not bother us, we expected city noises. There's a Metro station barely a block away. It's great to have a washer and dryer right in the apartment since we tend to pack very lightly. We greatly appreciated the neighborhood parking stickers Jeremey provided and we easily found parking about 1 block away on a safe, residential street. We'll stay here again next time we're in town.",1.0
Chicago,"This is a large, 1 bedroom apartment within 2 blocks of the blue line. Very convenient! There’s a well equipped full kitchen with a small grocery across the street. Of course there a numerous great restaurants in the area so there’s no need to cook. The apartment was very comfortable and clean. We had plenty of pillows, blankets, towels etc. which was much appreciated.",1.0
Chicago,"This was my very first AirBnB and if all of them are like this one, I'll never stay in a hotel again. Jeremey's communication was excellent from start to finish and his home is so beautiful and immaculate. It is easy to find and right off the blue line. The home had EVERYTHING I needed and then some. He even left me 2 day parking passes for the area which made people coming by easy to park nearby. It is in a very cool neighborhood and as a single woman staying in an area I've never been, I felt very safe. When I visit again, I would definitely stay there again.",1.0
Chicago,Jeremey is a wonderful host and his place is extremely nice. He is quick to respond with any questions and is willing to give recommendations around the city. The place was clean and decorated with care. It has everything you would need during your stay.,1.0
Chicago,"Jeremy's apartment is exactly as advertised - stylish, large, comfortable and spotlessly clean in a very safe, hip neighborhood.  The kitchen has all you would need to fix your own meals.  We, however, opted to take advantage of the multitude of excellent bars, coffee shops and restaurants within very easy walking distance on Division Street and North Milwaukee Avenue (for lovers of high quality Nepalese / Indian food we recommend Cumin on North Milwaukee). Communication with Jeremy was very easy.  If and when we return to this part of Chicago Wicker we would, without hesitation choose to stay in Jeremy's place.",1.0
Chicago,"We were very pleased with the apartment. With an updated modern kitchen and bathroom we had everything we needed to be comfortable. Jeremy was a great host, communicated all details we needed when needed.",1.0
Chicago,Jeremy's place was fantastic! It is really big. Was great to unpack and have space and feel at home. Really close to the blue line. Easy to get anywhere. Felt safe in the neighborhood. Fire station next door but never bothered us or woke us up. Would definitely stay again!,1.0
Chicago,Our stay was great! Jeremey was very responsive when we asked him about accommodating our two dogs during the stay. There was even a small crate provided that we ended up using for the smaller pup. Everything was just as described and the apartment is close to many great restaurants and shops. We'd stay again! :),1.0
Chicago,"Jeremey's place is fantastic -- it's bigger than we were expecting and has a really nice overall feel to it.  It's nicely decorated and has all the amenities you would need.  Jeremey was very quick to respond to messages and helped out if anything at all was needed.  Check-in was simple and the building felt secure.  It's just a couple minutes' walk to the blue line, which brings you right into downtown in about 10 minutes.  Also close to some cool spots on N Milwaukee, like Oiistar, the amazing ramen place.  Super nice experience and we'd definitely stay with Jeremey again!",1.0
Chicago,"This was perfect for our needs.  Everything was as advertised.  It's a beautiful space and the location is great.  (Ashland itself is not too appealing but you're a one-minute walk from blue line, can stroll west on Division or walk up Milwaukee Ave to Bucktown.).  Self-checkin was super easy and we had everything we needed.",1.0
Chicago,"Jeremy was very responsive, answering all questions quickly and thoroughly.  His place was nice and very clean.  My parents stayed at the Air BnB to visit me and were quite pleased.  Being that I own and live in downtown Chicago, I can say that this location fantastic and the price to be a great value.",1.0
Chicago,This place is one of the nicest accommodations I have ever stayed at. Yes the price is expensive compared to a hotel but if you want a solid night's sleep and little slice of home be sure to check out Jeremy's place!,1.0
Chicago,Wonderful place.  We really enjoyed ourselves and relaxed at Jeremey's loft.  Very clean.  We enjoyed being able to watch people on the streets from the loft.  Love the mixture of cultures which we don't get much of back home.  Location was great.  Very quick walk to get to Wicker Park and many great local restaurants as well.  Felt very safe in the neighborhood and at Jeremey's place.  Super nice people.  Jeremey is fantastic at returning messages.  Always a quick reply and we had no problems at all that couldn't be fixed quickly.  Highly recommend Jeremey's loft!,1.0
Chicago,"Jeremey's apartment far exceeded our expectations.  The pictures don't do justice to how beautiful, stylish and very spacious this place is, not to mention comfortable and clean.  Everything was simply perfect.  Every possible amenity to make you feel right at home--we wanted for nothing.  Comfortable bed and couches, beautiful, roomy bathroom with large shower and plenty of hot water, fully stocked kitchen, excellent wi-fi and incredibly easy check-in process. We loved the location, merely 2 short blocks (roughly 3 min) walk to the Blue line on the L/ subway.  So easy to get to the main attractions downtown, but also in a great spot to explore the Wicker Park/ West Town neighborhoods and all the great restaurants and shops.  An excellent Airbnb experience--Thank you, Jeremey!!",1.0
Chicago,We found it exactly as advertised—perhaps even better. Super accommodations in a great location. Jeremey was very accessible and promptly responded to our requests and questions. We look forward to staying there again on our next trip to Chicago.,1.0
Chicago,We LOVED the location. The area seemed very safe and was central to the blue line and a Divvy bike station. (Tip: take the blue line to and from O’hare to save a lot of money on transportation) The apartment was very roomy and we enjoyed having access to a kitchen. Something to note is the TV does not have cable or “smart” access. We ended up buying a firestick so we had something to watch while winding down at the end of our days. Jeremy was quick to respond any time we had questions or needed anything! Thank you for a great stay!,1.0
Chicago,"Better than it looked online, a beautiful space with everything needed and then some. Great location, close to public transportation and wonderful local spots. Jeremy was attentive and helpful with all of my queries. Would stay here whenever I’m in Chicago. Can’t recom enough!",1.0
Chicago,"This is a beautiful unit in a great neighborhood in Chicago.  Jeremy was a great host and was easy to communicate with.  Check-in and check-out were a breeze and the apartment was spotless.  It's on a busy street but there was very little noise.  The blue line is a block away as are Target, CVS and a bunch of great coffee shops and places to eat.  Also super easy to pick up a cab or an Uber/Lyft.  Would recommend this place without hesitation!",1.0
Chicago,Communication was fast and easy and Jeremey was available every step of the way.    Apartment was better than I expected.  Great location and very close to the Blue Line which can get you just about anywhere.     Would absolutely recommend and would stay here again in the future.   ,1.0
Chicago,"This is a spacious apartment and very nicely furnished. The location is just a few minutes walk from the blue line with quick transportation direct to the heart of downtown. Check-in was easy and the host provided a sheet with lots of helpful suggestions for local eating places, of which there are many.  Staying at Jeremey's place for 4 nights provided a very comfortable place to stay for our tired bodies after spending our days exploring Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,Jeremey’s place is very spacious and clean.  It has everything you need for a short or long term stay.  Jeremey is very nice and answers any question very promptly.  The location is also very convenient for travel on public transport.  Highly recommended!,1.0
Chicago,"Couldn't have asked for a better place. It was super easy to get to and from both town and O'Hare, with a Blue Line stop only one block away. It was beautiful and cheerful as well. Loved the full kitchen and nice extra-large tub. Jeremey was a lovely host. I wish we could have stayed even longer!",1.0
Chicago,"Great location with convenient transportation. The neighborhood has a cool vibe. As a vinyl record collector, I was excited about being across the street from Dusty Groove and close to Reckless Records. Great overall experience.",1.0
Chicago,"My wife and I spent 2 nights at Jeremey's place. While pictures can often be deceiving, we were pleasantly surprised at how large and open the apartment was in person. It was perfect. Jeremey was traveling in Spain at the time, but he was quick to respond to questions we had the day of and during the trip about things such as checking in and adjusting the nest thermostat. We'd happily stay there again.",1.0
Chicago,Great space in a convenient location—a vibrant neighborhood and just a block from blue line. The apartment has a good vibe and personality and is very clean. Jeremy was attentive and responsive. I’ll go back.,1.0
Chicago,"Jeremey's apartment is really great. It's large and bright in all the right places (and quieter and darker in the bedroom, which is lovely for sleeping), stylishly decorated (without being overdone--the decor fits the urban space perfectly), has a fantastic shower, everything you need for a comfortable stay and is in one of my favorite Chicago neighborhoods, with a bajiggety restaurants, bars, shops, etc. The provided parking passes are super helpful, especially for weekend stays, because parking in this part of the city is no joke (in fact, if you can manage without a car, do, because you won't need it once you're here--everything is walkable, lyft/uber is plentiful and the El train is literally right there.)  If mobility is an issue for you, you should know that you have to walk up a flight of steep, narrow stairs to get to the apartment. Also, it's really in the real city, and real cities generally aren't that quiet, so if you're a super sensitive sleeper who needs deep, dark silence, you'll maybe want to bring ear plugs and/or a sleep mask.   But otherwise, I completely recommend this place. Jeremey is a kind, helpful and responsive host, the apartment is so lovely, and it's a really great value for Chicago, too.",1.0
Chicago,"We enjoyed our stay at Jeremy’s place. It's conveniently located, about 15 minutes to the loop and 20 minutes to Midway airport. Although we got around with Uber, the blue line is just minutes across the street. The apartment is super clean and lovely decorated. Jeremy is very thoughtful with the travel guide and tips. It was great to meet a Cal alumni at Chicago. =) I would recommend this listing to everyone.",1.0
Chicago,"This home was great. Jeremey provided easy check in details and instructions. The location was great because I was close to everything downtown and many shops and stores. I recommend this home and would certainly stay here again. Thanks again, Jeremey!",1.0
Chicago,"Jeremy was easily accessible for any questions via text and he even checked in the second day to make sure everything was okay. The apartment spacious, comfortable and centrally located. Just a few steps to the blue line CTA train, restaurants and shops. The neighborhood is busy so the provided parking permits were a huge plus.",1.0
Chicago,"This space is amazing. Plenty of room, furnishings are great, kitchen has everything you could need, and the shower was perfect after a long day of exploring Chicago in the cold. Jeremey was prompt with responses and great about giving me tips on places to check out. Literally just a few steps away from the Blue Line which made getting around the city super easy. I will definitely be looking to get this place again next time I am in Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"Great place! We stayed there with our 18month during our summer holiday trip, all three of us loved Jeremey’s place. Bigger than expected. Jeremey was very supportive and fast with all kind of questions. We can highly recommend this place, also when you are traveling with small children.",1.0
Chicago,"What a great stay in Chicago!!! Jeremey‘s loft is perfectly situated in one of our favourite areas within Chicago. There are so many things to explore in walking distance: restaurants, shopping, parks, and the great 606 trail. The train („L“, blue line) - which is more or less directly in front of the apartment - connects you directly with downtown as well as with the airport. The apartment is so cool, we would love to live there! Despite the busy street in front of the house the apartments inside is so quiet and we slept like babies. Jeremey is a fantastic host and helped us a lot to find our ways, gave us great recommendations and answered immediately whenever we wrote a message. We will definitely come again!!!",1.0
Chicago,"A very spacious and spotlessly clean apartment, it holds special charm with bare brick walls and wooden floors with plenty of seating and a very large bed with a well equipped dressing room.  The bathroom is great with a very impressive bath for easing away the muscles after a long day of exploring.  We didn’t use the kitchen much apart from making a hot drink as we ate out most of the time but there is a great health food shop just opposite and a food shop just by the subway station.  Although we didn’t get to meet Jeremey his communication with us was superb.",1.0
Chicago,"Jeremy’s place is amazing, not only is it huge, it has everything you need for a comfortable stay, it’s in a great location for getting around town (literally one minute walk from the blue line at Division), and really easy to get to on the blue line from O’hare airport.  Jeremy was a fantastic host, very quick to respond to any queries we had, and was kind enough to let us leave our bags for a couple of hours while we went for brunch before heading back to the airport.  I would highly recommend his apartment to anyone wanting to explore Chicago.",1.0

Chicago,"Jeremey’s place is so beautiful, a perfect loft you could imagine with a view to a quiet street. It has lots of light, in the morning or in the evening too.

Chicago,Beautiful apartment thats is decorated to perfection. Its conveniently located (10 min walk to wicker park and 20 min subway to downtown). Jeremy was very accommodating and his local coffee & donut tips were great!,1.0
Chicago,"Rob’s place was beautiful! It looked exactly as advertised. The apartment was spacious & stylishly decorated. Lots of restaurants & bars within walking distance, as well as a grocery store. Rob was super responsive & hospitable. We were not able to check in before 3, but he allowed us to leave our luggage in his store prior to check in & even took it upstairs to the apartment for us! The only downside was that the bedroom can get a little warm, especially on a hot summer day. Other than that, we fully enjoyed our stay. Would definitely stay here again!",1.0
Chicago,"Rob’s Place was beautifully furnished and decorated. It was also only a 3 minute walk from the nearest bus stop which can take you to downtown or any of the metro/L lines - very convenient. The only downside is that there is no air conditioning in the bedroom so it got really hot. It is also on the 3rd floor so that’s something to consider if you don’t like taking the stairs. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and would recommend it!",1.0
Chicago,Rob's place is immaculate! I have never seen an Airbnb so tastefully decorated and cozy. Its in the middle of a bustling restaurant and shopping district but is surprisingly quiet. Rob himself was very responsive and a great host. I would definitely come back here for sure. Make sure you take advantage of the $20/day parking that Rob offers. It was a lifesaver.,1.0
Chicago,"My experience could not have been better. This was the mog immaculate, stylish, modern, and comfortable AirBnB experience I've ever had. The owner has spared no expense, from stainless steel alliances to remodeled bathrooms and showers, to new wood flooring. The temper-pedic bed was heavenly, and the furnishings were modern and comfortable. The attention to detail was unparalleled, from train maps and restaurant guides to Chicago artwork and plenty of cooking utensils and supplies, as well as beauty and hygiene products. I was beyond impressed with the level of care and consideration.   When I return to Chicago in the future, this will be my first choice. Always.",1.0
Chicago,We were In Chicago to see Hamilton and sightsee with our teenaged daughter. We loved this location and neighborhood. It felt safe and there were tons of nearby places to eat or get groceries. The condo itself was extremely clean and was well stocked with necessities. It was spacious and we never felt crowded. Rob was a great host and was very responsive to our questions. It was a plus to have  parking available as we never moved our car until we left Chicago. I would definitely rent from Rob again,1.0
Chicago,"Rob's place is incredibly stylish, supremely located, and overall provides a comfortable, beautiful perch from which to explore the city of Chicago.  As a host, Rob was incredibly hospitable and communicative, and was very helpful in getting me situated for the stay.  I highly recommend the apartment and would definitely stay here again!",1.0
Chicago,"This place is a fantastic stay!  Everything is wonderfully decorated, well thought-out, very clean, and it has an authenticity you can only find in a beautiful historic building.  The location is great as well. It’s a 13 minute drive to downtown Chicago, and 500 feet from the best breakfast place in town “Whisk”. You must go there!  Only thing missing in the Airbnb was coffee, so you may want to bring your own. But they have multiple ways to make it if you do.  Great stay, highly recommend this Airbnb!",1.0
Chicago,My wife and I came in to Chicago for our wedding anniversary and are so glad we chose to stay with Rob.  Probably the best Airbnb experience we’ve had.  He really thinks of everything and we can’t recommend staying here enough.,1.0

Chicago,"By far-this Rob's place is the most STUNNING home my husband and I stayed in. The décor is stylish, modern and pure class. The Holiday decorations made it festive and cozy. I really want those flocked trees!! LOL Absolutely gorgeous. The pictures of this listing does it NO JUSTICE!! Rob is a delight and one of thee most gracious hosts I have encountered. His level of hospitality is unparalleled and he gave us some great suggestions of local eateries in the area. His home is in great proximity to downtown and other neighborhoods. We truly could not be more pleased and dreaded leaving to return back to our home state. However, we will certainly be back and definitely in the process of making plans to book Rob's home again. You will not be disappointed!! Truly his home is a GEM!!!",1.0
Chicago,"The warmest home we've ever been in. Sparkling clean, modern and superb interior design, great location and a very lovely, warm host. Thank you, Rob and we promise to only stay at your place whenever we're in Chicago! An experience to remember!",1.0
Chicago,"This was the cleanest Airbnb we’ve ever stayed in. If you are picky with finding a clean place that actually FEELS clean, this home is for you. You can immediately tell that Rob takes pride in his apartment and everything is so well maintained and stylishly decorated. The bed was a welcomed place for rest after a long day, and we loved how firm the mattress was and how fluffy the pillows were—very comfortable.  The amenities were spot on, the coffeemaker, the gas stove, plenty of dishes and quality cookware to use for making a meal. Not mention, the exceptional decor of the entire apartment! The location was excellent and walkable to numerous local restaurants and bars (a few were literally steps from the apartment door). We loved being on the third floor and always felt super safe. There is some traffic noise that can be heard in the bedroom, but Rob provides earplugs for light sleepers. In truth, we actually enjoyed being lulled to sleep by the sounds of the city and it didn’t bother us at all. The convenience of the grocery store being a 5 minute walk away made buying some pantry and fridge essentials easy. The couch in the living room was super comfy and perfect for relaxing and watching the Thanksgiving Day parade and some Netflix Christmas movies. This was the perfect Airbnb and we were highly impressed (not always easy). 5 stars to Rob for such an amazingly clean, comfortable, stylish, and well thought out home away from home. We’ll be back soon!",1.0
Chicago,"This place is so much nicer in person! And wow the bed was so comfortable we ended up sleeping the first night we got there instead of going out because we got trapped in the bed lol. Communicating with Rob was very easy and his home was supplied with everything!! First aid kit, make up remover wipes you name it lol. The home is in a very quiet and safe neighborhood. Would definitely stay again, one of the nicest places I have ever stayed!",1.0
Chicago,"We had a short but wonderful stay at Rob's place for a weekend trip to Chicago. Communication and check-in were quick and easy, and it was a breeze to get there from the airport on the train and a bus.  The space was spotlessly clean and beautifully furnished, with thoughtful touches that made our stay really comfortable. The location is great too, with a grocery store nearby and lots of good food/drink options as well.  Our only regrets are that we didn't stay here longer to enjoy it more and that we had to catch a Sunday morning flight before we could peruse the beautiful store downstairs some more. We would definitely stay here again, and will happily recommend it to any family and friends who may be looking for a place to stay in Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"Rob’s apartment was exactly what we need for a wonderful stay in Chicago. It was styled beautifully and Rob provided everything we could possibly need- thought of everything!

Chicago,"This might be my favorite Airbnb stay to date. The apartment so stunning, clean, and comfortable and charming Ukrainian Village with so much to offer, we chose to make fewer trips into the heart of the city to spend more time enjoying and exploring the immediate surroundings both in and out of the apartment. Yoga, restaurants, shops, grocery...everything within walking distance and this little oasis to temporarily call home. Rob couldn’t have been a better host. Will be back for sure!",1.0
Chicago,Rob’s place was amazing. Right in the center of everything. The location was close to many restaurants and bars. It is also a short ride to surrounding neighborhoods and downtown. The place itself was amazing with all the amenities needed for a great stay. Rob was prompt in his communication and was right below if needed. The parking space was a bonus as it is hard to find parking in this neighborhood without a permit.,1.0
Chicago,"Location, atmosphere, beautiful decor, every thought to amenities (even a First Aid Kit!)... you simply can't go wrong with this great condo in Ukrainian Village.  It was a snowy weekend so we especially enjoyed the cabinet full of games!  We were visiting family in Streeterville and getting there was no problem at all.  Rob greeted us when I arrived, and check-out was very simple.  Also, my brother drove over from a neighboring city to meet me, so we appreciated the off-street parking for him and his daughter.  Stay with Rob!  You won't regret it.",1.0
Chicago,"This is a stylish, modern yet comfortable apartment located in a cool part of town with lots of options to dine and a young at heart hip vibe.  I felt like a movie star in the surroundings & was happy to find out that the amazing shop below actually sold some of the items that are featured in the living space. It is located on an active street on the 3rd floor of a recently enovated building.  Rob is extremely responsive and a caring host.  I look forward to staying there again!",1.0

Extremely clean. Special touches such as video games and snacks. Went above and beyond to provide a welcoming and safe environment. Room was stylized, modern. Plenty of amenities, even access to laundry. If we make our way back to town, we’ll stay here again. Thank you for making our first AirBNB memorable!",1.0
Chicago,"Great place to stay! Very clean and convenient to food and shops! Reminded me of being Ina little apartment. The shower was a bit small, so if you're a larger person it may be difficult to fit. But it was a very nice place and the host were quick to respond.",1.0

The decor is fantastic and we loved many of the little touches including the board games, tasteful art, game systems, and the water and drinks in the fridge were a welcome surprise after our evening arrival. Having central heat as well as a space heater in the unit helped make sure we stayed nice and toasty during our visit.

Chicago,"What a gem! Christopher’s place was exactly as described including a ton of extras. Christopher was quick to respond before and during my stay. He left a light on for me the night I arrived since I had a super late flight. He even checked in on me the next day to make sure I had everything I needed. The place was totally spotless. The bed was very comfy and there were tons of extra pillows. The kitchen was fully equipped and he even stocked it with several quick food items. These were much appreciated especially the first morning. The space felt so much more roomy than I was expecting. Ceilings are a bit lower being a garden unit but I had no problem at all with it. The water pressure in the shower was really great. Christopher made a really detailed welcome guide with lots of great info abt the neighborhood. The studio is only 3 short blocks away from a bus that takes you directly to the belmont el station (abt a 20-30 min ride). I felt very safe in the neighborhood (family vibe) even when coming in using transit late at night by myself. If you are wanting to do a lot of things in the Loop, transit took me 45-hour sometimes depending on the time of day. This was not a big deal for me bc I wanted a neighborhood experience vs more of a downtown touristy one, but it did take longer to get to and from. Lastly, Christopher was kind enough to  hold my luggage for me on my last day since I had a later flight. All in all, fantastic experience and I highly recommend this listing. Thank you so much, Christopher!",1.0
Chicago,Christopher’s place was was everything I could have hoped for. It was a nice cozy place where my girlfriend and I felt immediately at home.

Chicago,This is such a great place to stay! Awesome location between the airport and downtown. Uber’s were always there within 5 minutes and were reasonably priced for a ride to anywhere in the city.

Transportation was nearby and made our rides to the city very convinient, also we got to explore more of it by using transportation.

The water in the fridge was appreciated! We only stayed one night, but this place has everything you'd need for an extended stay. ",1.0
Chicago,Chris was an amazing host.  His place was very clean and better than we expected.  This was the wife’s first time visiting Chicago and she wasn’t disappointed as this place offers a lot of space for two guests.  Parking on the same street was hit and miss but that can be expected for a big city.  We took Lyft anytime we were visiting downtown Chicago.  It was nice to come and go as we pleased.  Chris responded very quickly to any messages that were sent.  I felt safe enough walking in the general neighborhood.  When we visit Chicago again this would definitely be the first choice.  Our first host cancelled which brought us to finding this gem.,1.0

Chicago,"Samantha & Jonathan's loft was exactly as pictured, and located in a convenient location. I loved the apartment - I would love to live here myself! The stairs to the loft was quite steep as others describe, and I left my suitcase downstairs and only went upstairs to sleep. The bed was very comfortable. My friend whom I stayed with wanted an easy access to the bathroom during night, so she decided to use the air mattress downstairs, which we found in the closet (we moved furnitures around to make space). The walk to the California CTA station was 15-20 min for me, but since it was quite a cold week, I often opted for Uber. As we had packed plans in downtown, we did not get to explore much of the neighborhood nor get to ask for neighborhood tips that Samantha was happy to share, but I'd love to come back to this loft and explore more!",1.0
Chicago,"The loft is located in a great quiet spot that is walking distance from great restaurants and bars. It was a ~15 minute walk from both the Logan Square and California blue line stops, and extremely close to tons and tons of good restaurants and bars (check out Lula, Giant, and Longman & Eagle). Samantha was a great host and the place was spotless when we arrived, with tea and some nice snacks sitting on the table. Checking in and out was as easy and quick as it gets, and we appreciated Samantha periodically messaging us to check on our experience. We would stay here again in a heartbeat. Our only warning is that all the stairs in the building are extremely steep and narrow. We didn't have any problems, but you should be careful. Overall a 5/5 experience.",1.0
Chicago,"The space is exactly as pictured.  Simple, basic, perfect for one or two people.  The bed in the loft was comfortable and the HDTV had plenty of premium channels.

Major bus line is 3 blocks away that will take you straight to the northside Fullerton train stops and the Blue Line station that goes to the loop is about 8 blocks away.  The host is easily reached and communication was great.  Thanks!",1.0

The apartment is spacious and has everything you need including cooking facilities, big comfortable bed, tv etc. We were a bit delayed and arrived late in the evening, but Samantha was extremely kind by helping us ordering pizza while we were absolutely wrecked from traveling. Furthermore, she always responded very quickly to questions from us. We ran in to her husband Jonathan a couple of times who was also super friendly and gave us a ton of advice on what to do in the city. Overall we had a great couple of days in Chicago and we definitely recommend this place! ",1.0
Chicago,"Samantha's place was perfect for our weekend getaway. Travel around the city was very convenient with transit and biking options very closeby. The space was extremely tidy and comfortable, and our hosts were very accommodating...thanks for a wonderful Chicago experience!",1.0
Chicago,"This apartment is great! The apartment itself is already beautiful and special with its high ceilings, and the location is also very nice. In walking distance from Logan square, with nice coffee bars, restaurants, shops and street art. But also in walking distance from public transport that takes you to downtown in just a few stops. We would definitely recommend this place for a great visit to this great city",1.0
Chicago,"Lovely loft studio, spotlessly clean and very well designed with everything we needed. Location is good with the metro about 15 mins walk away then 20 mins to downtown, and a Chicago bike scheme station 5mins away and an even quicker cycle to downtown. We also enjoyed the 606 trail, Chicago's answer to the Highline which is also close by.  So a great place and a great location.",1.0
Chicago,Beautiful apartment in quite neighborhood. The space is great it's location relative to public transit is awesome. Samantha was quick to respond to any questions. I will definitely be checking availability next time I'm back in Chicago.,1.0
Chicago,"We had a great stay at Logan Square. The appartment was spacious (more so than we expected) and very clean with thoughtful provisions provided.   Samantha and Jonathon provided us with a great list of nearby places do eat and drink (from fresh coffee to pizza) and were very helpful in communicating when we asked for help.   Logan Sqaure itself is a lovely leafy neighbourhood around half an hr from Downtown on the train. There's plenty of amenities a short walk from the appartment, as well as loads of great bars. A taxi into Downtown is quicker but more expensive.   The 'L' (elevated train) is a 15-20 min walk from the appt and then a further 15 min or so ride into downtown where there is plenty to do. A weekly ticket for the train is around $30 and gives you access to trains and buses. Very handy for getting around as the bus and L system is easy to use.  On a clear day, we would recommend hiring a bike and taking the Lake Shore route which runs alongside Lake Michigan. You get stunning views of the iconic skyscrapers from across the water.  Hancock Tower on a clear day is also a must see too, with great views for miles.  If the weather is cooler, then there are loads of great museums to visit. the History of Chicago by Lincoln Park is great. The Old Town is nearby for a drink afterwards too.  Definitely a great city to visit with lots to do, and a great appartment in a great neighbourhood. 10/10  Thanks",1.0
Chicago,"The apartment was lovely, clean, and the coffee/snacks were appreciated. The security within the apartment was great, and although the surrounding area was less confidence-inspiring, she had us send a photo of our car once we arrived, and the area had cameras, so it put me at ease. We were super close to both bus and train options that we utilized several times, and within walking distance of target for quick pick-ups. We enjoyed our stay!",1.0
Chicago,"Kay is the best superhost you will ever have!! She is great with communication and is very welcoming! Her apartment has a home-like feeling that will make your vacation even better. Cleanest place ever!! Absolutely spotless and smells amazing!!  If you are looking for suggestions of where to eat and shop, Kay will give you a list of her favorite places and provides a variety brochures, pamphlets, flyers, and food menu’s! I had mentioned my family was vegan and she gave me options of food choices around the area!  Great location!!! I highly recommend staying at Kay’s place if you are visiting Chicago!!",1.0
Chicago,"Kay’s place was very cute and clean!! She was super quick to respond to anything. The train is a quick walk from the apartment though I don’t think I would personally feel safe walking from the train tooo late at night as a young lady. Loved how she  had treats available like bananas, it’s, orange juice, coffee. It is very convenient for a quick trip to downtown Chicago!",1.0
Chicago,"Even though Kay's place was more on the south side of Chicago and I was going to the north side for a Cubs game, her place was great for a one-night stay with how reasonably priced it was right before Memorial Day weekend. I just got ubers to get to and from the game rather than public transit. Kay's place was very comfortable and she was a great host!",1.0
Chicago,"Kay’s place was amazing! Such thoughtful, kind touches, and Kay is super communicative. Seriously, this room was nicer and more well-equipped than some of the luxury hotel’s I’ve stayed at. 100% would stay here again!",1.0
Chicago,"From the extreme cleanliness of the apartment to the added extras everywhere you turn, this place was absolutely perfect! The host is respectful and generous with the most friendly senior kitty ever! Coming “home” to a snuggly feline in the living room was probably the best thing ever (I’m an extreme cat person). However, if you’re not into cats, no worries; the cat isn’t pushy and you could probably spend your entire trip ~not~ seeing him if that’s more your style. The off-street parking was clean and safe, something that can be hard to secure in Chicago. The apartment is located very close to both the train and the bus, making in-city traveling quite easy. I would highly recommend this AirBnB!",1.0
Chicago,It’s a wonderful and comfortable place to stay. Kay is really great at communicating with guests and is super nice and welcoming. The space is very clean and has a nice charm to it. We only stayed for one night but I definitely will keep this place in mind if I ever make it up to Chicago again.,1.0
Chicago,I extremely enjoyed my stay at Kay's place.  The location is perfect. My favorite part was having a Target with a Starbucks and market near by. This place is also closely located to a CTA and the freeway entrance if you have a car.  Kay provides many good ameneties and I was very happy for that. She is quickly responsive and super helpful. I'm glad I got to meet her. She is a sweet person.  It is 15 min away from the city.    Also if you have a rental/car there is parking near by!!!  Thanks Kay,1.0
Chicago,"Five stars isn’t enough! Kay made me feel very welcome and comfortable. I felt as if I was staying with family or an old friend, definitely not a stranger. She provided breakfast and coffee for me before I headed out and it definitely gave me a great start. I have a cat at my place, so their friendly lil guy made me feel even more at home. I would definitely recommend her to anyone else and will definitely stay with her again if the opportunity arises.",1.0
Chicago,"I was pleasantly surprised by how amazing the experience turned out to be at Kay's home. The entire house felt inviting and immediately puts you at ease. She puts the guest first and it shows in her thoughtful approach to outfitting the room. From soft bath towels and a loofah at your bedside, to the coffee and tea bar in the kitchen for hot drinks in the morning. She really wants you to feel like you are taken care of the moment you walk in the door. The location is convenient with good selection of restaurants in the area to choose from and downtown is a hop and a skip away for those who want to take in the sights. If it isn't obvious already,  I highly recommend staying with Kay during your trip to Chicago!",1.0
Chicago,"I stayed at Kay's place with two of my friends over St. Pat's weekend. The free parking was a huge blessing, and the apartment was very close to the CTA for local travel. The apartment itself was clean and well-kept. Kay was a wonderful host! From giving us travel recommendations to providing some St. Patrick's day accessories, she made our stay as enjoyable as possible. We also enjoyed helping ourselves to the coffee bar and playing with her adorable cat. All of our expectations for our stay were far exceeded and I would gladly stay here again.",1.0

Chicago,"Kay was a perfect host. She went out of her way to make sure I was comfortable and ensured I had everything I needed. Her place is so cute and even offers a breakfast bar with coffee, snacks and breakfast foods. She even left a loofa, towels and washcloths for me with chocolates. Also, there were loads of local brochures and magazines to browse. Her 16 year old cat Toby is such a love! He was super friendly and sweet. It was raining on the day I was going out to adventure in the city and I Kay was so cool about lending me her umbrella. She’s a kind soul and was so helpful with local tips for eats and getting around. Highly recommend staying at Kay’s!",1.0
Chicago,"Kay provided a great Airbnb! She was prompt in her responses and provided a few extra touches that made our stay very welcoming (water bottles in the room's mini-fridge, clear and prompt communication, breakfast items (although we skipped out on those), well-labeled instructions outside the door on how to get in as well as within the house to make things very clear, etc.)",1.0
Chicago,"Best Airbnb I've stayed in! Clean, safe, great communication, fantastic amenities, nice and modern/cozy/stylish vibe, easy check in and out, great location: basically this Airbnb had it all and then some! Kay was also super nice and accommodating. I would definitely stay here again and recommend to others!",1.0
Chicago,"Kay's place was perfect for me- free parking in a lot, close to the metro, and south (the direction I was coming from).  Kay is friendly, and her place is clean.  I'll definitely see if Kay's place is available the next time I  visit Chicago!",1.0
Chicago,Kay is an Amazing host with an air bnb that makes you feel at home! The entire house is sparkling clean and full of creative and cute decor. This room is spacious and fully furnished with all the amenities you may need. The check-in/out is simple with thorough instructions. The el (CTA train) is a short 5min walk in a safe neighborhood. This is the second time I’ve stayed here and both times there were other guests yet it was very quiet and comfortable stay and rest. Respect this space as it truly is a gem!,1.0
Chicago,Great stay. Kay’s place was in a great location close to downtown and public transportation. The room and bathroom were very clean and had nice touches. Didn’t meet Kay until the last night (my schedule) but she was very nice and personable. If definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone!! Thank you Kay,1.0

Chicago,"Kay's place was really awesome in a good neighborhood, easily accessible from public transport. Very highly recommended, especially for budget travelers like myself.   The apartment and room were cozy and I felt like being at home during my stay, with access to kitchen and living room area. The cat is super friendly too!   Kay as a person was a nice host. She even gave me some medicine upon request, as I was catching some cold from the weather in Chicago.   If I ever come back to Chicago I have a reliable place to stay :)",1.0
Chicago,"Kay is an absolute pro of a host.  She communicated check-in instructions very clearly and regularly  touched-base to make sure I had everything I needed during my stay.  Her place is ideally situated a mere 5 minute walk from an L train station (which is a fantastic way to get around Chicago as I discovered).  Very comfortable, clean, and safe place to spend your nights when visiting Chicago-- can't recommend enough.",1.0
Chicago,"The misfortune of staying at Kay's is that one will quickly realize that not every host will be like her! :-/ I was able to take the train (as she pre-stay suggested) directly out of midway and walk about 2 blocks & if cleanliness is next to godliness, then trust Kay has you covered. And to be completely honest, Kay extended herself to me in an act that goes way beyond the scope of AirBnb. I was comfortable, I felt safe, the room was very dedicated. Being that she was my 1st AirBnb experience,  I really feel like I lucked up. Omg, and her snack bar (fresh yummies), were too delish! :-* #BookHer",1.0
Chicago,"Kay is a fantastic host and I can not recommend her enough. When we contacted her for anything we needed, the response was lightning-fast! She was courteous and made her home warm and inviting for her guests. She really took a burden off our shoulders while planning a last-minute trip to Chicago. If you’re looking for a great experience for a really reasonable price, definitely book with Kay!",1.0
Chicago,"If I could give 6 stars I would. Kay's place was immaculate, cute, comfortable, easy to access — everything you could ask for in an Airbnb. Kay herself is an excellent and hospitable host, helping us out with umbrellas, breakfast, sunscreen, loofas — all the little things that shows she truly cares about making her guests' experience as amazing as possible. She is a gracious and generous person and I would 100% stay at her property again. ",1.0
Chicago,"If you don't like stairs or cats, that is the only reason not to stay here. Location is good, ample parking & light outdoors- ammenities are top & Kay is an awesome host with a BIG heart for her aging cat- that alone should make her 1st choice for any cat lover.",1.0
Chicago,Kay's place was absolutely amazing. She was a perfect host and made my vacation feel so comfortable. I was traveling alone and one late night she even messaged me to make sure I was ok.

We felt right at home. My colleagues and I kept looking around saying, ""I love this place. I don't want to leave"". On more than one night, we decided to stay in (rather than go out) just so we could enjoy the fire, movie, selection, and some homemade pasta! I will definiltey be recommending this to anyone and everyone who plans to visit Chicago. BONUS: Just down the street from the best diner/vegan food in the world.",1.0

Chicago,"Danielle’s space was perfect for our trip to Chicago. There were four of us, so we did two in each bed — totally comfortable. As it was February in Chicago, we loved the fireplace to keep the space nice and warm. The flat was very clean, and stocked with towels and products for the shower. Danielle gave us a mega list of recommendations ahead of time, which was super helpful and full of cool restaurants and bars. The apartment is in Logan Square, and while we spent a good deal of time there and in places like Wicker Park, the freezing weather had us in lots of Uber’s downtown as well — just something to keep in mind. Though, it’s also off a subway line. Overall, no complaints, and Danielle’s communication was amazing. Would definitely recommend.",1.0
Chicago,I love love love Danielle's place.  It's extremely charming and well decorated. You can definitely tell she put a lot of effort into all the details of the apartment.

I would highly recommend staying here and will likely book it again.,1.0

Chicago,"This has got to be in the top two best airbnb experiences I've had. Danielle's place is so cozy and looks amazing. We ended up spending a lazy Sunday lounging inside by the fireplace and watching dumb movies - an ideal way to spend a day after heavy touristing Friday and Saturday. She was incredibly accommodating throughout our stay with complications our party had with check in and check out. The surrounding area had an incredible pizza place, a bar where we got boozy ice cream floats, some breweries, and way more that we didn't have time to discover because we didn't want to leave the fire. Will 100% look to stay here again in the future!",1.0

Chicago,This was a truly desperate search for a safe place for my daughter to stay last minute while out of town.  She made last minute plans to travel to Chicago for the Gold Cup soccer match.  Once there she could not find a hotel to rent to her because she is 18.  She was in her car crying.  I booked with Jim on the internet and spoke with him by phone.  He was so great!!!  He met her and her boyfriend at the door.  He even spoke Spanish with her boyfriend which made him feel great.  He assured me by phone about how safe the neighborhood  was and that he would be on the premises just a moments notice away.  He treated them like adults but still helped me feel comfortable about their safety knowing they will always be my babies.  It was truly above and beyond.  And my daughter said the apartment was gorgeous.,1.0

Nice quiet neighborhood with Uber/lyft convenience to most city locations in 15-20 min. Apartment is on ground floor, some street noise but overall very quiet. Neighborhood is safe with quick walks to great eating spots. We recommend the little red wolf & mhenry.  Apartment is well furnished with nice appliances & conveniences, great WiFi. Host was attentive, but only needed on day 1: we’re pretty low key. Only recommendation would be additional blankets/ linens for pull out couch in living area.",1.0

Chicago,"Our stay in Chicago was great and we really enjoyed staying in Andersonville. It was far enough away to be quiet but only a 12-15 minute walk to the train station, which we didn’t mind at all. The neighborhood felt safe enough to walk in and we liked the local coffee shops and restaurants.   The apartment was nicely decorated and clean. I would just give a heads up that if you’re a light sleeper you can hear the hosts upstairs because it’s an old building. I would never take away a star for this because it’s just a personal thing. My wife is a heavy sleeper and it never bothered her but I had to download a white noise app on my phone to fall asleep.   The hosts were great communicators and asked if we needed anything and how our stay was going. We both enjoyed it and would stay here again!",1.0

Chicago,"Jim's place was FANTASTIC. The place was exactly what we expected it to be from the fabulous photos which were 100% accurate showing off the truly lovely and well decorated apartment. Very clean, well appointed, extra towels and pillows, fantastic magazines for relaxing reading, GREAT map of the local neighborhood in order to find fantastic local shops and places to eat.  You can totally get around on public transit (mostly CTA Bus) from this apartment. Note: the place is a little far from the CTA train stations into downtown. We rented a car and really appreciated the flexibility to get around the city easily and great neighborhood street parking.   The apartment is well appointed with everything you need for your stay. One of the bedrooms is street facing but there is not much traffic so it stayed very quiet at night. Air conditioning for the summer time is a huge plus on muggy hot days!  Andersonville neighborhood is one of my favorite areas of Chicago. It is quaint, full of local  charm, great eats and drinks within walking distance, and a fantastic way to get a feel of what real Chicago is like (and not the fake touristy stuff). Off the beaten path geek thing we did - we drove to and walked through the nearby Rosehill Cemetery Mausoleum. The old original section has a substantial collection of LC Tiffany stained glass windows and walking the completely silent hallways to see the sun shining through these beautiful windows is pretty awesome if you like that sort of thing.  Love Jim's place! Beyond 5 stars! We will hopefully be back to town and rent out his apartment again in the future. ",1.0

Chicago,"Amazing location, very walkable to all things that you need - restaurants, grocery stores, pharmacy, coffee shops, etc. worked great for 2 of us and the space is really clean and neat. We didn’t have a car and found it super easy to Uber most places outside the neighborhood. Thanks for a great stay!!",1.0
Chicago,"Loved Jim and Maximo’s place, it was very spacious, clean and stylish. I enjoyed looking through the magazines and the beds were extremely comfortable. The neighborhood is terrific, close enough to public transportation, cofffee shops, restaurants and not too far from the lake. Street parking was so easy, parked in front every time no matter what time of day. Thanks for an excellent experience for my family and me!",1.0
Chicago,"Jim’s place was (Website hidden by Airbnb) pictured and described...super cute, spacious, and comfy! Great neighborhood with access to awesome restaurants within walking distance, and easy ~12-15 min walk to red line to get into downtown. Our family also appreciated the local playgrounds and family vibe of the neighborhood. Jim and Maximo were wonderful hosts. They were quick to communicate with us and responsive to our needs. We would definitely stay again upon a return visit to Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"We really enjoyed staying at Jim's place over a quick weekend get-away to Chicago. It's very close to all the Andersonville shops and restaurants on Clark St. and a short walk to the el stop to go downtown; it's in a lovely, quiet, leafy neighborhood of brownstones. Parking was easy -- there was street parking right outside the apartment; we parked the car when we arrived Friday and didn't need to move it or use it until we left on Sunday. The apartment was very clean and well-appointed, with a great kitchen and nice amenities. Jim was there to give us the keys when we checked in; he and Maximo were available if needed but also gave us space. We'd highly recommend this one!",1.0
Chicago,"Stylish apartment in a great location with convenient parking and great restaurants/shops nearby. We really enjoyed our stay here. The kitchen had everything we needed to cook and prepare our own food. Jim was very responsive and accommodating, which made everything easy and enjoyable. I wish that we could have controlled the heat ourselves, but when the apartment started to get a bit chilly, we notified Jim, and he was able to turn on the heat for us quickly. Overall a great space and great experience!",1.0
Chicago,"Jim’s place is aesthetically pleasing, clean, and comfortable. It is in the lovely neighborhood of Andersonville and accessible to many restaurants and shops. I appreciated the clear communication, quick responses, ease of check in, and helpfulness when I needed to extend my stay. The house is well equipped with the conveniences and thoughtful touches that are helpful to a busy business traveler- a high quality iron and real ironing board, a washer and drier, toiletries, coffee etc.I would definitely stay at Jim’s place again.",1.0
Chicago,"We loved staying here! The place was beautiful, with many nice touches, a charming older building but remodelled with modern amenities, and sparkling clean. Getting in was very convenient, there were snacks left there for us to enjoy, parking on the street was easy, and Jim and Maximo always responded immediately to all of our queries, plus checked in to see if we wanted coffee, or needed anything else from them, checked on the comfort of the beds, and generally made sure that we had a great stay and felt well cared for. The kitchen is well appointed - the only thing not available was a microwave, but Maximo commented that he's about to get one for the apartment so that can be expected soon.  This is a great apartment with caring and involved hosts. I recommend staying here unconditionally!",1.0
Chicago,"The apartment was beautiful and very spacious. There are restaurants, grocery stores and pharmacies within walking distance. The neighborhood seemed very safe and we enjoyed walking around even in the cold weather. The Keurig and snack basket were nice touches which we appreciated. The beds were  too firm to be comfortable for me, but my boyfriend was fine with it, so it may be personal preference. Jim and Maximo were very attentive and always ready to help. Please note, the apartment does not have a microwave. Also, there is a policy that you cannot have any guest enter into the apartment (not just for sleeping, but for visiting too) which I misunderstood when booking, but it was not a problem since it was only the two of us. If you're traveling in a group or with family staying in other places, you may want to look for another place if you want them to be able to visit you. Overall our stay was lovely and we would recommend this apartment.",1.0
Chicago,"Location, location, location! The spot is located in a beautiful historic neighbourhood filled with lots of charm, great shops, and fantastic restaurants within walking distance. The space was incredibly clean, beautifully decorated, and had everything we needed for a great weekend. Jim was a great host and provided all the amenities we could have needed. 10/10 would stay here again!",1.0
Chicago,"This is a clean and beautifull apartment. Really clean and tidy, felt like home.  Close to coffee shops and general shops.  Jim and Maximo  checked up on me to make sure all my needs were meet and told me where the good coffee shops are. I highly recommend staying. I will deff come back in the future. 10/10 :)",1.0
Chicago,"This was my second stay at Ellie’s place, and I maintain that it’s one of the best Airbnbs ever! So quiet, clean, stylish, and comfortable. The tub is awesome and the coffee’s great, what more could I ask for?",1.0
Chicago,"Place was great! Clean, cozy, great location. Check in & out went seamlessly. LOVED the bathtub and shower. I would definitely recommend. The TV package was a surprising plus.. not usually one to hang out too much at a bnb- but after a day of drinking at Wrigley we were feeling a little rough-  it was so nice to just chill out the next day watching movies and ordering food! Loved it!",1.0
Chicago,"As a single traveler the studio set up was perfect for me. The location was great, since I had just been staying downtown at a conference prior to my stay it was nice to get out a bit and see some other neighborhoods. I could easily walk to the 606 Trail - which I really enjoyed - and N Milwaukee Ave for some fun shopping. I appreciated the guide they had in the studio with local recommendations listed, I got take-out from the Indian place down the street and it was delicious. Very comfortable bed!",1.0
Chicago,"Elinor went above and beyond to accommodate our stay, the level of hospitality was excellent!   The space is gorgeous and welcoming. I love that every detail was thought out, and this carries out throughout all the pieces in the home. Definitely a gem in the city.",1.0
Chicago,"Loved my stay here! Very comfortable bed, very clean, artistic space, thoughtful books and postcards, easy check in and out. Highly recommend staying here if you want to be in the Wicker Park area of Chicago!",1.0
Chicago,"I absolutely loved this place! I already told my sister that when we get the chance to go to Chicago together we will absolutely have to stay there. It was the perfect size and had everything I needed. The style of the whole place was gorgeous. I can tell a lot of thought went into creating this space. The shower and bathtub were amazing, and it was very helpful that there was a hair dryer, shampoo/conditioner, body wash, etc. When I do get the chance to travel to Chicago again I hope this is available. I can’t say enough about how much I loved this place!",1.0
Chicago,"From the incredibly easy check in and location, to the thoughtful touches that made us feel at home, to the impeccably curated style, we absolutely loved stayed here. It will be our go to any time we are back in Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"What can I say except that Elinor’s place was great! The little touches, such as welcome beers, pour over coffee, books on Chicago, and available toilet trees (we flew in and only had carry-one) were perfect. We only used the room for sleeping since we spent most of our day and night exploring the city! The weather is Chicago sure is unpredictable and crazy, so make sure you have a jacket or umbrella on stand by! Haha Thank you again for allowing us to stay in your lovely place!",1.0
Chicago,"We loved this place! It has all of the amenities and comfort of a nice hotel and more. The space was stunning, just like the photos. It felt very private which was great. We appreciated all of the books about Chicago and local restaurants. We’ll be back!",1.0
Chicago,This place is exactly as it looks! Super cute with personal touches so you know you’re getting an authentic experience. It’s close enough to the L to make traveling to and from the city accessible! Would for sure stay here again; wish I had more time :),1.0
Chicago,"OMG this place is so fantastic. It's PERFECT. I'm going to stay here again for sure! Great location, excellent host, so stylish and cool. The place also comes with an amazing little booklet to tell you how to use the WiFi and coffeemaker, and how to get around.",1.0
Chicago,"If I had more a sense of self-interest, I would write the  worst review ever so that this amazing space is always available for me when I'm in Chicago. First: it is it's own little building in the city. Wow! It's designed so beautifully, I took tons of photos to inspire my guest house back in CT. Elinor was responsive, accommodating, and super nice. I'm spreading the word to all of my friends who are jazzed staying there. The location is 10-12 minutes from downtown... well worth it for these gorgeous accommodations. BTW: the photos don't really capture the details and inviting sweetness of the place. I'll see you again, Elinor!",1.0
Chicago,"Ellie and Devin's space is charming! It's a well-designed, well-maintained large studio with incredibly thoughtful touches: books about the history of Chicago, more books from Chicago based writers and poets, games, postcards, and even stamps. I was a little nervous the first night with the studio being so close to the street, but I slept like a dream – the bed is comfortable and the studio is airy and bright. The place is exactly as pictured, even better. Ellie and Devin were very responsive and helpful. I would definitely come back and highly recommend staying here.",1.0
Chicago,This place is in the best part of the city! So easy to walk everywhere! It is clean with amazing amenities! The cute little touches! The great bath and shower! The delicious pour-over coffee! I want to stay there again.,1.0
Chicago,Elinor’s apartment is the perfect place for a cozy and stylish stay in Chicago. Everything we could’ve needed was provided and Elinor’s neighborhood recommendations were superb! I would highly recommend this place to anyone wanting to visit Chicago (and to avoid tourist traps)!,1.0
Chicago,"I can’t say it enough- this is THE best Airbnb I’ve ever stayed at and is so cozy! It’s worth every penny! I came to take my boards and it was just perfect for the stay. It’s so stylish, quaint, adorable neighborhood, and the little touches are unlimited! There was wine and beer stocked in the fridge, a cute pour over coffee pot and trader joe beans with a grinder! Basically I’m sad I can’t just move and stay in forever. People always say, “oh I’ll be back” but this is serious, I can’t wait to book again! I have best friends who live in the city and I’d still pay to stay in this awesome space! Airbnb MVP! Don’t hesitate! Book it now!",1.0
Chicago,"What you see on the photos are absolutely accurate and more! Loved the open space, high ceilings and obviously the bath. I've been using Airbnb for most of my travels and this is one of the nicest and most aesthetically pleasing location I have ever stayed at!",1.0
Chicago,"My fiancé and I were in town to celebrate our anniversary weekend. We couldn't have picked a better place to stay. The open layout, soft lighting, and claw foot tub all made it seem like a dream. Thank you so much!",1.0
Chicago,"Ellie was fantastic, super fast responses to my emails. Her place was fantastic, and right in the neighborhood where we needed to be. Hate to say this, but she could easily get more per night given the location and how awesome the space is.   Cheers!",1.0
Chicago,"Great place! Great host! We actually had major delays on our flight out of Chicago and she offered for us to stay another night. We felt loved and cared for. If you want a spot not in the downtown hustle but still in the city enough to Uber for good rates, look no further. Quiet neighborhood. Pictures described the space very accurately. It was the perfect space for a quick getaway to Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"Amazing and beautiful first airbnb experience. The place was decorated very modern and was clean. Both the walk in shower and claw-foot tub were great and the water got very hot. The bed was super comfy! There were plenty of towels, extra sheets, and blankets to use as well. There were also nice personal touches such as food recommendations and stocked beverages in the fridge (water filter, coffee, and some wine). Me and my boyfriend had an amazing time.",1.0
Chicago,"Wonderful place to stay while visiting the windy city of Chicago! Not far from great restaurant, bars, shopping and downtown. The coach house is decorated to perfection in mid-century modern decor and very clean. My husband and I used Uber all weekend and waiting no longer than 2 min. for a pickup at the house.  Highly recommend a stay at this location.",1.0
Chicago,"Great place to stay in Chicago. The space is very functionable and artsy, open and airy- we loved it. Comfy bed, all amenities you would want and then far more are provided. There are even beautiful post cards for you to write home with! Highly recommend it!",1.0
Chicago,Ellie’s place is exactly what you see in the all - no false advertising. It’s very light and open and she maximizes the space greatly. She’s very easy to communicate with. The Damen & Western L stations are close enough walk which we utilized a lot. Would definitely stay here again!,1.0
Chicago,"Gorgeous! I loved staying here. It was in a cool neighborhood and the studio was clean, styled well, and the bathroom was top notch. I want to stay here every time I come back to Chicago. They also have postcards and stamps for your use. Sweet little detail. Thanks so much!",1.0
Chicago,"This is a fantastic place. Super bright, extremely clean, great design, and extremely comfortable. Parking was easy. Check in and check out were super convenient and Elinor was very responsive. Can’t recommend highly enough!",1.0
Chicago,Eleanor's place was fantastic! Every detail was thought of including the courtesy postcards depicting her cat who sits in the window in the house on Artesian Street on the front. I would come back to Chicago just to hang out in this cool Studio for a weekend.,1.0
Chicago,"This is a gem of a space that is a close walk to some great cafes, shopping, and night life. As someone who travels a fair amount, I would say this was one of my favorite stays at an AirBNB. The space itself is very thoughtfully curated. ",1.0
Chicago,"There is a reason so many reviews start with how stylish the place is. That reason is because it is stunning and just as advertised! The level of detail and thought put in to the design is unbelievable.   Location is great, quick walk to the blue line. Check in/out is super easy, and the studio manual made our interactions minimal.   Great place to stay, will absolutely repeat.   Thanks again!",1.0
Chicago,"This place was great. It's worth the price just to swim around in that huge bathtub. Ellie was a great host, and the apartment had everything you could need for a great time in Chicago. I found most places I needed to go (food, cute shops, metro) to be about a ~10 min walk away, which I don't mind because I love to walk, but if you don't consider getting a car. It was really easy to get to downtown using the train. I have no complaints, this was an awesome  place!",1.0
Chicago,"This is such a cute, clean and comfortable space! I could stay here for weeks! Nice little neighborhood. Had initially worried about noise at night, but it did quiet down for a restful evening.  The fresh ground coffee, sodas, beer help to make it comfortable. Nice distance from downtown. Safe to run in the mornings with a park nearby. Love this place!",1.0
Chicago,"Ellie’s studio is absolutely stunning! She goes above & beyond for her guest! There are loads of local nicknacks laying around the studio to indulge into. She has her cabinets stocked with things one might need (ibuprofen, cotton swabs, razors, etc). The neighbor hood is very nice. There are not many of taxi’s in the area, so if you don’t drive one might want to download uber. Definitely worth the stay! Would definitely come back!",1.0
Chicago,"Fantastic stay! The studio was as pristine as pictured. You felt more like you were staying in a hotel than someone's home. Great amenities like shampoo, soft towels and even yoga mats! Would highly recommend,",1.0
Chicago,"Elinor's studio was a magical place, and I could tell as I soon as I stepped up to the door, because care was taken in styling the exterior with little faerie lights that sparkled. I hate to say this, but I can be a bit of snob when it comes aesthetic and decor. I have not one complaint about this studio. I was absolutely blown away. The incredible level of detail and design, even down to the studio's handbook was meticulous and thought out.  What's even more wonderful is the central location to all the haunts in the Bucktown/Wicker Park area. I drove and literally everywhere I went was less than a 10 minutes away. I can't imagine that taking public transportation would take any longer. If you do drive, Elinor provides a parking permit, which gives you the freedom to park anywhere in the vivinity without the fear of getting a ticket.  By far Elinor's place is one of the best spots I've stayed in for Air BnB. If you're looking for something magical and romantic (oh, I forgot to mention there's wonderfully restored claw-foot Victorian bath tub) look no further.",1.0
Chicago,Stayed here while visiting Chicago. The apartment was really clean and cozy and located in a really good location for our trip. We were able to park right out front for our stay and walk everywhere. If you're looking to spend time in the Ukrainian Village i would recommend staying here. Close to the train if ya want to travel other places too.,1.0
Chicago,"The initial observation of the space was of course a stylish space for a reasonable price.  Seeing the space in person is such an enjoyable experience - especially when noticing all the fine details not revealed in the online pics.  It is in those details that raises the level of impression and sets it apart from other spaces.    Elinor and I had minimal contact, but that was because instructions were clear on the check-in and check-out procedures, where to park, and even how to make the coffee - which we were thoroughly confused at first.    I enjoy exploring different places to stay when visiting areas, but I would consider staying here again on my next trip to Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"I enjoyed my stay at Elinor's studio apartment in Wicker Park.  The location was pefect for me.  The studio was quite stylish and had many personal touches, including a studio manual which I found quite helpful and fun.  I really appreciated the 2 bottles of wine and the beer selection in the fridge.  The kitchen was minimal but that was fine with me because I planned to enjoy Chicago's dining scene.  The bed was  very confortable, which was a definite plus.  The heater was somewhat louder than I was expecting, but that is the only concern I had.  I would definitely stay here again.",1.0
Chicago,"This is a great spot. Located near hip Wicker Park and related. Quiet, good access to Metro and very pleasant spot to hang out and do some work too. Hostess was very helpful on restaurants etc . This is a top BnB!!!",1.0
Chicago,"The space is exactly as described. Gorgeous. The bathroom is stylish, clean, and the shower is great. Would love to have a space like that in my own home tbh. They have cute touches throughout the studio, including Where Chefs Eat (I have that at home too!) and Studs Terkel's ""Working"" in the bathroom. The bed was really comfortable and once we figured out how to configure the NEST properly for our purposes, the temperature control was on point. One minor note is that both heat and cool air come out predominantly at the head of the bed, and it could be bothersome to people who are sensitive to dry air. My wife had to turn to the foot of the bed one night because she's super sensitive, but it didn't bother me much. The location was good for me because I don't need to be right downtown and don't mind taking a Lyft everywhere, plus I like to be in ""real"" neighborhoods. Puerto Rican restaurants abound as well as cool street art, if you care to venture around. It's about a twenty minute drive to many downtown area attractions. The hosts were very accommodating to my needs, as I had to cancel one day due to a family emergency. They were very easy to work with throughout. Will definitely look to return here my next stay in Chicago",1.0
Chicago,Elinor's place is close to perfect. Every corner of the space is thoughtfully detailed and styled. It's located very centrally to Logan Square and the Bucktown/Wicker Park area and I enjoyed walking the neighborhood in my downtime. Her communication was clear and extremely quick and I truly cannot say enough about how pleasant my stay was. Highly recommended.,1.0
Chicago,"Before I arrived, I loved the photos and thought the place would be perfect for my stay over New Year's. Walking in, it was somehow even better. From the furniture to the lighting to the tableware, everything in the space is very intentionally curated. I have a feeling the owners are designers; the whole place has a great aesthetic while still being comfortable. One of my favorite places I've stayed so far",1.0
Chicago,"We had a great stay at this charming, stylish studio. Clean digs and thoughtful touches like coffee, beer, and wine were lovely. Location was perfect for getting around town by foot or Lyft, yet the street itself was quiet and residential. Great host communication and simple check in and check out. Would stay again in a heartbeat!",1.0
Chicago,"I love this spot . The layout, decor and vibe are definitely hip. Everything is so easy + the communication with Elinor is on point. The amenities are great . The experience is very hommie , every time you discover little details that make a difference in your stay.   If you’re looking for something local, not loud ,  away from tourists this is definitely a good location.",1.0
Chicago,"Ellie’s place is so so wonderful! Chic, stylish, beautiful location from which you can easily access the trendiest Chicago area, Wicker Park. Ellie responds in mere minutes should you need anything and the keypad entry makes it so easy to come and go as you please, no need for keys! 10/10 would recommend and hope to stay here again! ❤️",1.0
Chicago,"Beautiful decor with so much space! Instructions for checkin were easy to follow. The coffee and extras were great!  Very comfortable bed! The apartment has an urban ambiance. Jeremy provided parking passes and we were able to find parking a block away. Communication was excellent. Jeremy answered any questions I had almost immediately. Neighborhood had a safe feel. We walked to local restaurants close by. One unfortunate thing, which was no fault of our host- when we went to leave, we discoveredthat our catalytic converter was stolen off of our car. I had driven our older SUV since I knew it would be parked for several days. Turns out, these are easiervehicles to get under and cut. I would not hesitate to stay here again.",1.0
Chicago,"This Airbnb is the best! Location and space are the key highlights! Jeremy has great design taste! Close to the train and many restaurants. We would definitely stay here again! If you’re visiting, try the rolled ice cream across the street! We had it twice!",1.0
Chicago,"The apartment was absolutely fantastic and everything was as good as advertised. The entire unit was much more spacious than it appeared in the photos which was a welcomed surprise as I have stayed in several Airbnb's that were smaller than photographed.   You could not ask for a better location, one block from the blue line which made traveling to/from O'Hare and into downtown a breeze. You're also within walking distance to countless top notch restaurants and shops.  Jeremy was a very responsive and accommodating host and he really made us feel taken care of when we had some flight plan changes. I would recommend this apartment to anyone wanting to visit Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"There is much to like about this apartment.  It's spacious, has full amenities, plenty of character, parking is included, and the place is clean.  Wicker Park is growing, has a unique vibe, feels safe, and offers options within walking distance for groceries.  The area also has many choices for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and drinks.  We chose to use the kitchen for breakfast, and the waffle maker was a great perk.  A critical factor in comfort, rest and relaxation is the bed.  While clean, we found the mattress to be uncomfortable.  It currently presents itself as firm and lumpy with indentations and sag from years of use.  Upgrading this one very important item would make this location, apartment, and experience worth renting again.  We enjoyed our stay overall and will keep this as an option in the future.",1.0
Chicago,"Came to Chicago for my cousin's birthday party. It was in my old neighborhood, so I felt very much at home. The place was spacious and exactly how it was described! I briefly meet Jeremy when I arrived, he was extremely nice. Would love to come back here when I visit Chicago again.",1.0
Chicago,"I loved this loft and everything about it.  The location was great - 1.5 blocks from the CTA - we were able to explore the entire city using public transportation.  Check in and check out were a breeze.  Jeremy was kind and offered great suggestions when we met briefly during the stay.  The apartment was spotlessly clean, comfortable, quiet and well appointed.  This was my first visit to Chicago and I would gladly stay here on my next trip.",1.0
Chicago,"We loved this place. It's spacious and very convenient. If you have small children, you may want to know that there is a firehouse nearby, but it did not bother us, we expected city noises. There's a Metro station barely a block away. It's great to have a washer and dryer right in the apartment since we tend to pack very lightly. We greatly appreciated the neighborhood parking stickers Jeremey provided and we easily found parking about 1 block away on a safe, residential street. We'll stay here again next time we're in town.",1.0
Chicago,"This is a large, 1 bedroom apartment within 2 blocks of the blue line. Very convenient! There’s a well equipped full kitchen with a small grocery across the street. Of course there a numerous great restaurants in the area so there’s no need to cook. The apartment was very comfortable and clean. We had plenty of pillows, blankets, towels etc. which was much appreciated.",1.0
Chicago,"This was my very first AirBnB and if all of them are like this one, I'll never stay in a hotel again. Jeremey's communication was excellent from start to finish and his home is so beautiful and immaculate. It is easy to find and right off the blue line. The home had EVERYTHING I needed and then some. He even left me 2 day parking passes for the area which made people coming by easy to park nearby. It is in a very cool neighborhood and as a single woman staying in an area I've never been, I felt very safe. When I visit again, I would definitely stay there again.",1.0
Chicago,Jeremey is a wonderful host and his place is extremely nice. He is quick to respond with any questions and is willing to give recommendations around the city. The place was clean and decorated with care. It has everything you would need during your stay.,1.0
Chicago,"Jeremy's apartment is exactly as advertised - stylish, large, comfortable and spotlessly clean in a very safe, hip neighborhood.  The kitchen has all you would need to fix your own meals.  We, however, opted to take advantage of the multitude of excellent bars, coffee shops and restaurants within very easy walking distance on Division Street and North Milwaukee Avenue (for lovers of high quality Nepalese / Indian food we recommend Cumin on North Milwaukee). Communication with Jeremy was very easy.  If and when we return to this part of Chicago Wicker we would, without hesitation choose to stay in Jeremy's place.",1.0
Chicago,"We were very pleased with the apartment. With an updated modern kitchen and bathroom we had everything we needed to be comfortable. Jeremy was a great host, communicated all details we needed when needed.",1.0
Chicago,Jeremy's place was fantastic! It is really big. Was great to unpack and have space and feel at home. Really close to the blue line. Easy to get anywhere. Felt safe in the neighborhood. Fire station next door but never bothered us or woke us up. Would definitely stay again!,1.0
Chicago,Our stay was great! Jeremey was very responsive when we asked him about accommodating our two dogs during the stay. There was even a small crate provided that we ended up using for the smaller pup. Everything was just as described and the apartment is close to many great restaurants and shops. We'd stay again! :),1.0
Chicago,"Jeremey's place is fantastic -- it's bigger than we were expecting and has a really nice overall feel to it.  It's nicely decorated and has all the amenities you would need.  Jeremey was very quick to respond to messages and helped out if anything at all was needed.  Check-in was simple and the building felt secure.  It's just a couple minutes' walk to the blue line, which brings you right into downtown in about 10 minutes.  Also close to some cool spots on N Milwaukee, like Oiistar, the amazing ramen place.  Super nice experience and we'd definitely stay with Jeremey again!",1.0
Chicago,"This was perfect for our needs.  Everything was as advertised.  It's a beautiful space and the location is great.  (Ashland itself is not too appealing but you're a one-minute walk from blue line, can stroll west on Division or walk up Milwaukee Ave to Bucktown.).  Self-checkin was super easy and we had everything we needed.",1.0
Chicago,"Jeremy was very responsive, answering all questions quickly and thoroughly.  His place was nice and very clean.  My parents stayed at the Air BnB to visit me and were quite pleased.  Being that I own and live in downtown Chicago, I can say that this location fantastic and the price to be a great value.",1.0
Chicago,This place is one of the nicest accommodations I have ever stayed at. Yes the price is expensive compared to a hotel but if you want a solid night's sleep and little slice of home be sure to check out Jeremy's place!,1.0
Chicago,Wonderful place.  We really enjoyed ourselves and relaxed at Jeremey's loft.  Very clean.  We enjoyed being able to watch people on the streets from the loft.  Love the mixture of cultures which we don't get much of back home.  Location was great.  Very quick walk to get to Wicker Park and many great local restaurants as well.  Felt very safe in the neighborhood and at Jeremey's place.  Super nice people.  Jeremey is fantastic at returning messages.  Always a quick reply and we had no problems at all that couldn't be fixed quickly.  Highly recommend Jeremey's loft!,1.0
Chicago,"Jeremey's apartment far exceeded our expectations.  The pictures don't do justice to how beautiful, stylish and very spacious this place is, not to mention comfortable and clean.  Everything was simply perfect.  Every possible amenity to make you feel right at home--we wanted for nothing.  Comfortable bed and couches, beautiful, roomy bathroom with large shower and plenty of hot water, fully stocked kitchen, excellent wi-fi and incredibly easy check-in process. We loved the location, merely 2 short blocks (roughly 3 min) walk to the Blue line on the L/ subway.  So easy to get to the main attractions downtown, but also in a great spot to explore the Wicker Park/ West Town neighborhoods and all the great restaurants and shops.  An excellent Airbnb experience--Thank you, Jeremey!!",1.0
Chicago,We found it exactly as advertised—perhaps even better. Super accommodations in a great location. Jeremey was very accessible and promptly responded to our requests and questions. We look forward to staying there again on our next trip to Chicago.,1.0
Chicago,We LOVED the location. The area seemed very safe and was central to the blue line and a Divvy bike station. (Tip: take the blue line to and from O’hare to save a lot of money on transportation) The apartment was very roomy and we enjoyed having access to a kitchen. Something to note is the TV does not have cable or “smart” access. We ended up buying a firestick so we had something to watch while winding down at the end of our days. Jeremy was quick to respond any time we had questions or needed anything! Thank you for a great stay!,1.0
Chicago,"Better than it looked online, a beautiful space with everything needed and then some. Great location, close to public transportation and wonderful local spots. Jeremy was attentive and helpful with all of my queries. Would stay here whenever I’m in Chicago. Can’t recom enough!",1.0
Chicago,"This is a beautiful unit in a great neighborhood in Chicago.  Jeremy was a great host and was easy to communicate with.  Check-in and check-out were a breeze and the apartment was spotless.  It's on a busy street but there was very little noise.  The blue line is a block away as are Target, CVS and a bunch of great coffee shops and places to eat.  Also super easy to pick up a cab or an Uber/Lyft.  Would recommend this place without hesitation!",1.0
Chicago,Communication was fast and easy and Jeremey was available every step of the way.    Apartment was better than I expected.  Great location and very close to the Blue Line which can get you just about anywhere.     Would absolutely recommend and would stay here again in the future.   ,1.0
Chicago,"This is a spacious apartment and very nicely furnished. The location is just a few minutes walk from the blue line with quick transportation direct to the heart of downtown. Check-in was easy and the host provided a sheet with lots of helpful suggestions for local eating places, of which there are many.  Staying at Jeremey's place for 4 nights provided a very comfortable place to stay for our tired bodies after spending our days exploring Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,Jeremey’s place is very spacious and clean.  It has everything you need for a short or long term stay.  Jeremey is very nice and answers any question very promptly.  The location is also very convenient for travel on public transport.  Highly recommended!,1.0
Chicago,"Couldn't have asked for a better place. It was super easy to get to and from both town and O'Hare, with a Blue Line stop only one block away. It was beautiful and cheerful as well. Loved the full kitchen and nice extra-large tub. Jeremey was a lovely host. I wish we could have stayed even longer!",1.0
Chicago,"Great location with convenient transportation. The neighborhood has a cool vibe. As a vinyl record collector, I was excited about being across the street from Dusty Groove and close to Reckless Records. Great overall experience.",1.0
Chicago,"My wife and I spent 2 nights at Jeremey's place. While pictures can often be deceiving, we were pleasantly surprised at how large and open the apartment was in person. It was perfect. Jeremey was traveling in Spain at the time, but he was quick to respond to questions we had the day of and during the trip about things such as checking in and adjusting the nest thermostat. We'd happily stay there again.",1.0
Chicago,Great space in a convenient location—a vibrant neighborhood and just a block from blue line. The apartment has a good vibe and personality and is very clean. Jeremy was attentive and responsive. I’ll go back.,1.0
Chicago,"Jeremey's apartment is really great. It's large and bright in all the right places (and quieter and darker in the bedroom, which is lovely for sleeping), stylishly decorated (without being overdone--the decor fits the urban space perfectly), has a fantastic shower, everything you need for a comfortable stay and is in one of my favorite Chicago neighborhoods, with a bajiggety restaurants, bars, shops, etc. The provided parking passes are super helpful, especially for weekend stays, because parking in this part of the city is no joke (in fact, if you can manage without a car, do, because you won't need it once you're here--everything is walkable, lyft/uber is plentiful and the El train is literally right there.)  If mobility is an issue for you, you should know that you have to walk up a flight of steep, narrow stairs to get to the apartment. Also, it's really in the real city, and real cities generally aren't that quiet, so if you're a super sensitive sleeper who needs deep, dark silence, you'll maybe want to bring ear plugs and/or a sleep mask.   But otherwise, I completely recommend this place. Jeremey is a kind, helpful and responsive host, the apartment is so lovely, and it's a really great value for Chicago, too.",1.0
Chicago,"We enjoyed our stay at Jeremy’s place. It's conveniently located, about 15 minutes to the loop and 20 minutes to Midway airport. Although we got around with Uber, the blue line is just minutes across the street. The apartment is super clean and lovely decorated. Jeremy is very thoughtful with the travel guide and tips. It was great to meet a Cal alumni at Chicago. =) I would recommend this listing to everyone.",1.0
Chicago,"This home was great. Jeremey provided easy check in details and instructions. The location was great because I was close to everything downtown and many shops and stores. I recommend this home and would certainly stay here again. Thanks again, Jeremey!",1.0
Chicago,"Jeremy was easily accessible for any questions via text and he even checked in the second day to make sure everything was okay. The apartment spacious, comfortable and centrally located. Just a few steps to the blue line CTA train, restaurants and shops. The neighborhood is busy so the provided parking permits were a huge plus.",1.0
Chicago,"This space is amazing. Plenty of room, furnishings are great, kitchen has everything you could need, and the shower was perfect after a long day of exploring Chicago in the cold. Jeremey was prompt with responses and great about giving me tips on places to check out. Literally just a few steps away from the Blue Line which made getting around the city super easy. I will definitely be looking to get this place again next time I am in Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"Great place! We stayed there with our 18month during our summer holiday trip, all three of us loved Jeremey’s place. Bigger than expected. Jeremey was very supportive and fast with all kind of questions. We can highly recommend this place, also when you are traveling with small children.",1.0
Chicago,"What a great stay in Chicago!!! Jeremey‘s loft is perfectly situated in one of our favourite areas within Chicago. There are so many things to explore in walking distance: restaurants, shopping, parks, and the great 606 trail. The train („L“, blue line) - which is more or less directly in front of the apartment - connects you directly with downtown as well as with the airport. The apartment is so cool, we would love to live there! Despite the busy street in front of the house the apartments inside is so quiet and we slept like babies. Jeremey is a fantastic host and helped us a lot to find our ways, gave us great recommendations and answered immediately whenever we wrote a message. We will definitely come again!!!",1.0
Chicago,"A very spacious and spotlessly clean apartment, it holds special charm with bare brick walls and wooden floors with plenty of seating and a very large bed with a well equipped dressing room.  The bathroom is great with a very impressive bath for easing away the muscles after a long day of exploring.  We didn’t use the kitchen much apart from making a hot drink as we ate out most of the time but there is a great health food shop just opposite and a food shop just by the subway station.  Although we didn’t get to meet Jeremey his communication with us was superb.",1.0
Chicago,"Jeremy’s place is amazing, not only is it huge, it has everything you need for a comfortable stay, it’s in a great location for getting around town (literally one minute walk from the blue line at Division), and really easy to get to on the blue line from O’hare airport.  Jeremy was a fantastic host, very quick to respond to any queries we had, and was kind enough to let us leave our bags for a couple of hours while we went for brunch before heading back to the airport.  I would highly recommend his apartment to anyone wanting to explore Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,We had a very nice stay at Jeremy’s Airbnb. Lots of space and a big kitchen. Jeremy responds quickly to questions and everything went very smooth. It is in a good location if you want to explore Wicker Park.,1.0

Chicago,"Jeremey’s place is so beautiful, a perfect loft you could imagine with a view to a quiet street. It has lots of light, in the morning or in the evening too. Subway is 1 minute walking distance (literally)! Fire station in the adjacent building is not bothering at all, they turned out to be the most quiet neighbors we ever had :) Many thanks to Jeremey, we would like to return!",1.0
Chicago,Beautiful apartment thats is decorated to perfection. Its conveniently located (10 min walk to wicker park and 20 min subway to downtown). Jeremy was very accommodating and his local coffee & donut tips were great!,1.0
Chicago,"Rob’s place was beautiful! It looked exactly as advertised. The apartment was spacious & stylishly decorated. Lots of restaurants & bars within walking distance, as well as a grocery store. Rob was super responsive & hospitable. We were not able to check in before 3, but he allowed us to leave our luggage in his store prior to check in & even took it upstairs to the apartment for us! The only downside was that the bedroom can get a little warm, especially on a hot summer day. Other than that, we fully enjoyed our stay. Would definitely stay here again!",1.0
Chicago,"Rob’s Place was beautifully furnished and decorated. It was also only a 3 minute walk from the nearest bus stop which can take you to downtown or any of the metro/L lines - very convenient. The only downside is that there is no air conditioning in the bedroom so it got really hot. It is also on the 3rd floor so that’s something to consider if you don’t like taking the stairs. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and would recommend it!",1.0
Chicago,Rob's place is immaculate! I have never seen an Airbnb so tastefully decorated and cozy. Its in the middle of a bustling restaurant and shopping district but is surprisingly quiet. Rob himself was very responsive and a great host. I would definitely come back here for sure. Make sure you take advantage of the $20/day parking that Rob offers. It was a lifesaver.,1.0
Chicago,"My experience could not have been better. This was the mog immaculate, stylish, modern, and comfortable AirBnB experience I've ever had. The owner has spared no expense, from stainless steel alliances to remodeled bathrooms and showers, to new wood flooring. The temper-pedic bed was heavenly, and the furnishings were modern and comfortable. The attention to detail was unparalleled, from train maps and restaurant guides to Chicago artwork and plenty of cooking utensils and supplies, as well as beauty and hygiene products. I was beyond impressed with the level of care and consideration.   When I return to Chicago in the future, this will be my first choice. Always.",1.0
Chicago,We were In Chicago to see Hamilton and sightsee with our teenaged daughter. We loved this location and neighborhood. It felt safe and there were tons of nearby places to eat or get groceries. The condo itself was extremely clean and was well stocked with necessities. It was spacious and we never felt crowded. Rob was a great host and was very responsive to our questions. It was a plus to have  parking available as we never moved our car until we left Chicago. I would definitely rent from Rob again,1.0
Chicago,"Rob's place is incredibly stylish, supremely located, and overall provides a comfortable, beautiful perch from which to explore the city of Chicago.  As a host, Rob was incredibly hospitable and communicative, and was very helpful in getting me situated for the stay.  I highly recommend the apartment and would definitely stay here again!",1.0
Chicago,"This place is a fantastic stay!  Everything is wonderfully decorated, well thought-out, very clean, and it has an authenticity you can only find in a beautiful historic building.  The location is great as well. It’s a 13 minute drive to downtown Chicago, and 500 feet from the best breakfast place in town “Whisk”. You must go there!  Only thing missing in the Airbnb was coffee, so you may want to bring your own. But they have multiple ways to make it if you do.  Great stay, highly recommend this Airbnb!",1.0
Chicago,My wife and I came in to Chicago for our wedding anniversary and are so glad we chose to stay with Rob.  Probably the best Airbnb experience we’ve had.  He really thinks of everything and we can’t recommend staying here enough.,1.0
Chicago,Rob’ s space is 5 stars & beyond. He has gone the extra steps to make his guests well informed about the neighborhood & totally took care of everything you need to be comfortable away from your home.

Chicago,"By far-this Rob's place is the most STUNNING home my husband and I stayed in. The décor is stylish, modern and pure class. The Holiday decorations made it festive and cozy. I really want those flocked trees!! LOL Absolutely gorgeous. The pictures of this listing does it NO JUSTICE!! Rob is a delight and one of thee most gracious hosts I have encountered. His level of hospitality is unparalleled and he gave us some great suggestions of local eateries in the area. His home is in great proximity to downtown and other neighborhoods. We truly could not be more pleased and dreaded leaving to return back to our home state. However, we will certainly be back and definitely in the process of making plans to book Rob's home again. You will not be disappointed!! Truly his home is a GEM!!!",1.0
Chicago,"The warmest home we've ever been in. Sparkling clean, modern and superb interior design, great location and a very lovely, warm host. Thank you, Rob and we promise to only stay at your place whenever we're in Chicago! An experience to remember!",1.0
Chicago,"This was the cleanest Airbnb we’ve ever stayed in. If you are picky with finding a clean place that actually FEELS clean, this home is for you. You can immediately tell that Rob takes pride in his apartment and everything is so well maintained and stylishly decorated. The bed was a welcomed place for rest after a long day, and we loved how firm the mattress was and how fluffy the pillows were—very comfortable.  The amenities were spot on, the coffeemaker, the gas stove, plenty of dishes and quality cookware to use for making a meal. Not mention, the exceptional decor of the entire apartment! The location was excellent and walkable to numerous local restaurants and bars (a few were literally steps from the apartment door). We loved being on the third floor and always felt super safe. There is some traffic noise that can be heard in the bedroom, but Rob provides earplugs for light sleepers. In truth, we actually enjoyed being lulled to sleep by the sounds of the city and it didn’t bother us at all. The convenience of the grocery store being a 5 minute walk away made buying some pantry and fridge essentials easy. The couch in the living room was super comfy and perfect for relaxing and watching the Thanksgiving Day parade and some Netflix Christmas movies. This was the perfect Airbnb and we were highly impressed (not always easy). 5 stars to Rob for such an amazingly clean, comfortable, stylish, and well thought out home away from home. We’ll be back soon!",1.0
Chicago,"This place is so much nicer in person! And wow the bed was so comfortable we ended up sleeping the first night we got there instead of going out because we got trapped in the bed lol. Communicating with Rob was very easy and his home was supplied with everything!! First aid kit, make up remover wipes you name it lol. The home is in a very quiet and safe neighborhood. Would definitely stay again, one of the nicest places I have ever stayed!",1.0
Chicago,"We had a short but wonderful stay at Rob's place for a weekend trip to Chicago. Communication and check-in were quick and easy, and it was a breeze to get there from the airport on the train and a bus.  The space was spotlessly clean and beautifully furnished, with thoughtful touches that made our stay really comfortable. The location is great too, with a grocery store nearby and lots of good food/drink options as well.  Our only regrets are that we didn't stay here longer to enjoy it more and that we had to catch a Sunday morning flight before we could peruse the beautiful store downstairs some more. We would definitely stay here again, and will happily recommend it to any family and friends who may be looking for a place to stay in Chicago.",1.0
Chicago,"Rob’s apartment was exactly what we need for a wonderful stay in Chicago. It was styled beautifully and Rob provided everything we could possibly need- thought of everything!

Chicago,"Rob’s place is one of the nicest, best located, and real value of all the places we have stayed!

I will most certainly stay here again.",1.0
Chicago,"This might be my favorite Airbnb stay to date. The apartment so stunning, clean, and comfortable and charming Ukrainian Village with so much to offer, we chose to make fewer trips into the heart of the city to spend more time enjoying and exploring the immediate surroundings both in and out of the apartment. Yoga, restaurants, shops, grocery...everything within walking distance and this little oasis to temporarily call home. Rob couldn’t have been a better host. Will be back for sure!",1.0
Chicago,Rob’s place was amazing. Right in the center of everything. The location was close to many restaurants and bars. It is also a short ride to surrounding neighborhoods and downtown. The place itself was amazing with all the amenities needed for a great stay. Rob was prompt in his communication and was right below if needed. The parking space was a bonus as it is hard to find parking in this neighborhood without a permit.,1.0
Chicago,"Location, atmosphere, beautiful decor, every thought to amenities (even a First Aid Kit!)... you simply can't go wrong with this great condo in Ukrainian Village.  It was a snowy weekend so we especially enjoyed the cabinet full of games!  We were visiting family in Streeterville and getting there was no problem at all.  Rob greeted us when I arrived, and check-out was very simple.  Also, my brother drove over from a neighboring city to meet me, so we appreciated the off-street parking for him and his daughter.  Stay with Rob!  You won't regret it.",1.0
Chicago,"This is a stylish, modern yet comfortable apartment located in a cool part of town with lots of options to dine and a young at heart hip vibe.  I felt like a movie star in the surroundings & was happy to find out that the amazing shop below actually sold some of the items that are featured in the living space. It is located on an active street on the 3rd floor of a recently enovated building.  Rob is extremely responsive and a caring host.  I look forward to staying there again!",1.0

Chicago,"This was our first AirBNB and I gave 5 stars all the way through. Chris was an amazing host. Quick responses and clear communication. Super helpful with us as we learned to navigate city, food and parking. Being from a rural area, we were grateful to have the help! Maps on fridge. Nice residential area, felt safe even at night. Extremely clean. Special touches such as video games and snacks. Went above and beyond to provide a welcoming and safe environment. Room was stylized, modern. Plenty of amenities, even access to laundry. If we make our way back to town, we’ll stay here again. Thank you for making our first AirBNB memorable!",1.0
Chicago,"Great place to stay! Very clean and convenient to food and shops! Reminded me of being Ina little apartment. The shower was a bit small, so if you're a larger person it may be difficult to fit. But it was a very nice place and the host were quick to respond.",1.0

The decor is fantastic and we loved many of the little touches including the board games, tasteful art, game systems, and the water and drinks in the fridge were a welcome surprise after our evening arrival. Having central heat as well as a space heater in the unit helped make sure we stayed nice and toasty during our visit. We didn't take advantage of them, but the fact that a washer and dryer were available was a nice bonus.   We'll definitely look here first on our next trip to Chicago!",1.0

Chicago,"What a gem! Christopher’s place was exactly as described including a ton of extras. Christopher was quick to respond before and during my stay. He left a light on for me the night I arrived since I had a super late flight. He even checked in on me the next day to make sure I had everything I needed. The place was totally spotless. The bed was very comfy and there were tons of extra pillows. The kitchen was fully equipped and he even stocked it with several quick food items. These were much appreciated especially the first morning. The space felt so much more roomy than I was expecting. Ceilings are a bit lower being a garden unit but I had no problem at all with it. The water pressure in the shower was really great. Christopher made a really detailed welcome guide with lots of great info abt the neighborhood. The studio is only 3 short blocks away from a bus that takes you directly to the belmont el station (abt a 20-30 min ride). I felt very safe in the neighborhood (family vibe) even when coming in using transit late at night by myself. If you are wanting to do a lot of things in the Loop, transit took me 45-hour sometimes depending on the time of day. This was not a big deal for me bc I wanted a neighborhood experience vs more of a downtown touristy one, but it did take longer to get to and from. Lastly, Christopher was kind enough to  hold my luggage for me on my last day since I had a later flight. All in all, fantastic experience and I highly recommend this listing. Thank you so much, Christopher!",1.0

Chicago,This is such a great place to stay! Awesome location between the airport and downtown. Uber’s were always there within 5 minutes and were reasonably priced for a ride to anywhere in the city.

Transportation was nearby and made our rides to the city very convinient, also we got to explore more of it by using transportation. Chris and Paul were very effective communicators they responded within a few minutes of us sending a message. We will definetely book again  when we go back to visit our family in the Chicago area.

Chicago,Chris was an amazing host.  His place was very clean and better than we expected.  This was the wife’s first time visiting Chicago and she wasn’t disappointed as this place offers a lot of space for two guests.  Parking on the same street was hit and miss but that can be expected for a big city.  We took Lyft anytime we were visiting downtown Chicago.  It was nice to come and go as we pleased.  Chris responded very quickly to any messages that were sent.  I felt safe enough walking in the general neighborhood.  When we visit Chicago again this would definitely be the first choice.  Our first host cancelled which brought us to finding this gem.,1.0

Chicago,"Chris was very accommodating and went above and beyond. There were some basic foods in the fridge, fruit, eggs, soda, and pancake mix. He also held our bags for us on our last day and let us pick them up one the way out. Very nice guy and was always on top of things.",1.0
Chicago,"I can't give Christopher enough praise! This was absolutely perfect for our first trip to Chicago and the basement studio was just wonderful! Not only was it incredibly clean, stocked with snacks and home-y touches, but it was very comfortable and Christopher was an amazing host. He was very open to helping us with our bags when we were a little early to check in and he held them for us so we could go explore the city and enjoy our visit. He was great at communicating with us in a professional and timely manner, and his place was extremely clean and organized. We really made the right decision by staying here! We hope to come back to the area and we will be looking to stay here again! I would recommend to anyone coming to the area! ",1.0

I’ll definitely be coming back!",1.0

Chicago,"Chris' place is really lovely! Plenty of space for 2 people, with lots of thoughtful touches like biscuits, bottled water, tea and coffee etc! The kitchen was well equipped to make meals, and Chris quickly provided a can opener when we asked to borrow one. The washer and dryer in the apartment were also very handy. Good location in a residential neighbourhood, about 10-15 min walk to the local Aldi and 10 mins to shops, including the currency exchange to get bus tickets. 5 mins walk from the bus stop that takes you to the blue line, which then takes you to O'hare airport or downtown. It takes around an hour to get to the Museum campus, and about 45 mins to attractions like the Skydeck and Hancock Tower. Chris recommended an architecture boat tour which was fab. Communication was always fast and helpful, would definitely recommend!",1.0

Chicago,"Samantha’s place was perfect for our short stay! It was very clean, stylish and cozy. The small, secluded patio was a sweet surprise. Only things to note- the stairs are very steep and the neighbors have a puppy, which was loud when we came in after a concert during quiet hours. Check in instructions were thorough and easy! We would love to stay again.",1.0
Chicago,"Samantha's apartment was clean, cozy, and had great lighting. She was kind enough to let us store our luggage when we arrived early.

Chicago,"Samantha’s place is modern cute chic. Every piece of furniture is well thought out with aesthetic and function in mind. The steps to the loft bedroom: first, it’s very roomy up there and cozy. The steps itself could be problematic for people who are afraid of heights but for someone like me who is uncoordinated, it was surprisingly easy to navigate. Although, I didn’t need anything, Samantha made me feel like she was only an email/text/phone call away if I needed assistance or info. Also, there’s a small but very cute balcony where u can enjoy your morning coffee.",1.0
Chicago,Fun spot to serve as base camp to explore Chicago as you can reach a bunch of fun neighborhoods inside of 30 min. The unit itself was extremely clean and Samantha was super responsive. The lock box makes check in and out simple. Added touches like the full kitchen and French press are a bonus. ,1.0
Chicago,"I had a great stay at Samantha's. The space was lovely and very clean. I didnt spend much time here because I like to explore when I visit a new place, but I appreciated the relaxing and simple vibe of the space at the end of a long day. Samantha and I communicated via text and I found her to be very kind and accommodating regarding a specific inquiry that I had. If you're looking and this place is free, book it now!",1.0
Chicago,"Samantha's place was the perfect place to explore logan square, we used to live in the city and hadn't done much exploring there.

We got awesome suggestions on places to eat and drink and it doesn't take too long to get into the city. 10/10 would recommend!!",1.0
Chicago,"Samantha & Jonathan's loft was exactly as pictured, and located in a convenient location. I loved the apartment - I would love to live here myself! The stairs to the loft was quite steep as others describe, and I left my suitcase downstairs and only went upstairs to sleep. The bed was very comfortable. My friend whom I stayed with wanted an easy access to the bathroom during night, so she decided to use the air mattress downstairs, which we found in the closet (we moved furnitures around to make space). The walk to the California CTA station was 15-20 min for me, but since it was quite a cold week, I often opted for Uber. As we had packed plans in downtown, we did not get to explore much of the neighborhood nor get to ask for neighborhood tips that Samantha was happy to share, but I'd love to come back to this loft and explore more!",1.0
Chicago,"The loft is located in a great quiet spot that is walking distance from great restaurants and bars. It was a ~15 minute walk from both the Logan Square and California blue line stops, and extremely close to tons and tons of good restaurants and bars (check out Lula, Giant, and Longman & Eagle). Samantha was a great host and the place was spotless when we arrived, with tea and some nice snacks sitting on the table. Checking in and out was as easy and quick as it gets, and we appreciated Samantha periodically messaging us to check on our experience. We would stay here again in a heartbeat. Our only warning is that all the stairs in the building are extremely steep and narrow. We didn't have any problems, but you should be careful. Overall a 5/5 experience.",1.0
Chicago,"The space is exactly as pictured.  Simple, basic, perfect for one or two people.  The bed in the loft was comfortable and the HDTV had plenty of premium channels.  The neighborhood is quiet and we felt safe.  Parking on the street wasn't an issue for us, but it did seem to be full in the evening.  Major bus line is 3 blocks away that will take you straight to the northside Fullerton train stops and the Blue Line station that goes to the loop is about 8 blocks away.  The host is easily reached and communication was great.  Thanks!",1.0
Chicago,"I enjoyed my stay in this space! The studio itself was very clean and quiet during sleeping hours. The staircase to the bed was a little steeper than I had expected, but it was sturdy and I got used to it. It was in a lovely location that had access to buses and trains. I did do a bit of walking, but that was my choice. Samantha and Jonathan were quick with communication and gave suggestions for the area. I would stay again. Thanks!",1.0

We would definitely stay here again. Thank you!",1.0
Chicago,"Samantha's place is absolutely marvelous! It's located in a nice residential area, with some fun bars and restaurants in the neighborhood. If you don't want to wait for a bus, it's a bit of a walk to the blue line, but nothing bad. Uber rides into the city were not that expensive and an easy way to get into the city. The apartment itself is really, really nice. Clean, spacious and an extremely comfy bed. I would highly recommend it to anybody!",1.0
Chicago,A very stylish flat with lots of complimentary toiletries and helpful guide books for the area. The flat isn’t in the city centre but taking an Uber carpool is a cheap and easy way of getting into the main part.,1.0
Chicago,This is a beautifully-designed loft apartment in an upmarket part of town.  It is sparkling clean and has some nice touches such as local coffee. Communication with Samantha was very smooth and she answered our questions quickly.  I would highly recommend staying here in Chicago.,1.0
Chicago,"Lovely apartment in a great area of the city.  Local amenities were perfect (I'd recommend Tony's for any grocery requirement and Wyler Road for a chilled drink and a bit to eat!) and not too far from the ""L"" to the Loop where it's a 20 min ride in.   Hosts were great and very responsive to any request and requirement we had and helped out as much as possible.  The stairs up to the mezzanine are definitely steep but we expected this from the description so not a problem at all and the apartment is carefully thought out to give maximum usability of the space.  Overall a fantastic expperience of this amazing city.",1.0
Chicago,"Place was amazing! My boyfriend and I absolutely loved our stay here in this loft. Area is very clean and very stylish. All of our questions were answered very fast and accurately. Everything was supplied for us, they even had Q-tips lol. ",1.0
Chicago,"We had an amazing stay at Samantha's place. It is located in a quiet neighborhood within 20min walking distance from the blue line. The apartment is spacious and has everything you need including cooking facilities, big comfortable bed, tv etc. We were a bit delayed and arrived late in the evening, but Samantha was extremely kind by helping us ordering pizza while we were absolutely wrecked from traveling. Furthermore, she always responded very quickly to questions from us. We ran in to her husband Jonathan a couple of times who was also super friendly and gave us a ton of advice on what to do in the city. Overall we had a great couple of days in Chicago and we definitely recommend this place! ",1.0

In walking distance from Logan square, with nice coffee bars, restaurants, shops and street art. But also in walking distance from public transport that takes you to downtown in just a few stops. We would definitely recommend this place for a great visit to this great city",1.0
Chicago,"Lovely loft studio, spotlessly clean and very well designed with everything we needed. Location is good with the metro about 15 mins walk away then 20 mins to downtown, and a Chicago bike scheme station 5mins away and an even quicker cycle to downtown. We also enjoyed the 606 trail, Chicago's answer to the Highline which is also close by.  So a great place and a great location.",1.0
Chicago,Beautiful apartment in quite neighborhood. The space is great it's location relative to public transit is awesome. Samantha was quick to respond to any questions. I will definitely be checking availability next time I'm back in Chicago.,1.0
Chicago,"We had a great stay at Logan Square. The appartment was spacious (more so than we expected) and very clean with thoughtful provisions provided.   Samantha and Jonathon provided us with a great list of nearby places do eat and drink (from fresh coffee to pizza) and were very helpful in communicating when we asked for help.   Logan Sqaure itself is a lovely leafy neighbourhood around half an hr from Downtown on the train. There's plenty of amenities a short walk from the appartment, as well as loads of great bars. A taxi into Downtown is quicker but more expensive.   The 'L' (elevated train) is a 15-20 min walk from the appt and then a further 15 min or so ride into downtown where there is plenty to do. A weekly ticket for the train is around $30 and gives you access to trains and buses. Very handy for getting around as the bus and L system is easy to use.  On a clear day, we would recommend hiring a bike and taking the Lake Shore route which runs alongside Lake Michigan. You get stunning views of the iconic skyscrapers from across the water.  Hancock Tower on a clear day is also a must see too, with great views for miles.  If the weather is cooler, then there are loads of great museums to visit. the History of Chicago by Lincoln Park is great. The Old Town is nearby for a drink afterwards too.  Definitely a great city to visit with lots to do, and a great appartment in a great neighbourhood. 10/10  Thanks",1.0
Chicago,"The apartment was lovely, clean, and the coffee/snacks were appreciated. The security within the apartment was great, and although the surrounding area was less confidence-inspiring, she had us send a photo of our car once we arrived, and the area had cameras, so it put me at ease. We were super close to both bus and train options that we utilized several times, and within walking distance of target for quick pick-ups. We enjoyed our stay!",1.0
Chicago,"Kay is the best superhost you will ever have!! She is great with communication and is very welcoming! Her apartment has a home-like feeling that will make your vacation even better. Cleanest place ever!! Absolutely spotless and smells amazing!!  If you are looking for suggestions of where to eat and shop, Kay will give you a list of her favorite places and provides a variety brochures, pamphlets, flyers, and food menu’s! I had mentioned my family was vegan and she gave me options of food choices around the area!  Great location!!! I highly recommend staying at Kay’s place if you are visiting Chicago!!",1.0
Chicago,"Kay’s place was very cute and clean!! She was super quick to respond to anything. The train is a quick walk from the apartment though I don’t think I would personally feel safe walking from the train tooo late at night as a young lady. Loved how she  had treats available like bananas, it’s, orange juice, coffee. It is very convenient for a quick trip to downtown Chicago!",1.0
Chicago,"Even though Kay's place was more on the south side of Chicago and I was going to the north side for a Cubs game, her place was great for a one-night stay with how reasonably priced it was right before Memorial Day weekend. I just got ubers to get to and from the game rather than public transit. Kay's place was very comfortable and she was a great host!",1.0
Chicago,"Kay’s place was amazing! Such thoughtful, kind touches, and Kay is super communicative. Seriously, this room was nicer and more well-equipped than some of the luxury hotel’s I’ve stayed at. 100% would stay here again!",1.0
Chicago,"From the extreme cleanliness of the apartment to the added extras everywhere you turn, this place was absolutely perfect! The host is respectful and generous with the most friendly senior kitty ever! Coming “home” to a snuggly feline in the living room was probably the best thing ever (I’m an extreme cat person). However, if you’re not into cats, no worries; the cat isn’t pushy and you could probably spend your entire trip ~not~ seeing him if that’s more your style. The off-street parking was clean and safe, something that can be hard to secure in Chicago. The apartment is located very close to both the train and the bus, making in-city traveling quite easy. I would highly recommend this AirBnB!",1.0
Chicago,It’s a wonderful and comfortable place to stay. Kay is really great at communicating with guests and is super nice and welcoming. The space is very clean and has a nice charm to it. We only stayed for one night but I definitely will keep this place in mind if I ever make it up to Chicago again.,1.0
Chicago,I extremely enjoyed my stay at Kay's place.  The location is perfect. My favorite part was having a Target with a Starbucks and market near by. This place is also closely located to a CTA and the freeway entrance if you have a car.  Kay provides many good ameneties and I was very happy for that. She is quickly responsive and super helpful. I'm glad I got to meet her. She is a sweet person.  It is 15 min away from the city.    Also if you have a rental/car there is parking near by!!!  Thanks Kay,1.0
Chicago,"Five stars isn’t enough! Kay made me feel very welcome and comfortable. I felt as if I was staying with family or an old friend, definitely not a stranger. She provided breakfast and coffee for me before I headed out and it definitely gave me a great start. I have a cat at my place, so their friendly lil guy made me feel even more at home. I would definitely recommend her to anyone else and will definitely stay with her again if the opportunity arises.",1.0
Chicago,"I was pleasantly surprised by how amazing the experience turned out to be at Kay's home. The entire house felt inviting and immediately puts you at ease. She puts the guest first and it shows in her thoughtful approach to outfitting the room. From soft bath towels and a loofah at your bedside, to the coffee and tea bar in the kitchen for hot drinks in the morning. She really wants you to feel like you are taken care of the moment you walk in the door. The location is convenient with good selection of restaurants in the area to choose from and downtown is a hop and a skip away for those who want to take in the sights. If it isn't obvious already,  I highly recommend staying with Kay during your trip to Chicago!",1.0
Chicago,"I stayed at Kay's place with two of my friends over St. Pat's weekend. The free parking was a huge blessing, and the apartment was very close to the CTA for local travel. The apartment itself was clean and well-kept. Kay was a wonderful host!

Her place is so cute and even offers a breakfast bar with coffee, snacks and breakfast foods. She even left a loofa, towels and washcloths for me with chocolates. Also, there were loads of local brochures and magazines to browse. Her 16 year old cat Toby is such a love! He was super friendly and sweet. It was raining on the day I was going out to adventure in the city and I Kay was so cool about lending me her umbrella. She’s a kind soul and was so helpful with local tips for eats and getting around. Highly recommend staying at Kay’s!",1.0
Chicago,"Kay provided a great Airbnb!

Chicago,Kay is an Amazing host with an air bnb that makes you feel at home! The entire house is sparkling clean and full of creative and cute decor. This room is spacious and fully furnished with all the amenities you may need. The check-in/out is simple with thorough instructions. The el (CTA train) is a short 5min walk in a safe neighborhood. This is the second time I’ve stayed here and both times there were other guests yet it was very quiet and comfortable stay and rest. Respect this space as it truly is a gem!,1.0
Chicago,Great stay. Kay’s place was in a great location close to downtown and public transportation. The room and bathroom were very clean and had nice touches.

The apartment and room were cozy and I felt like being at home during my stay, with access to kitchen and living room area. The cat is super friendly too!   Kay as a person was a nice host. She even gave me some medicine upon request, as I was catching some cold from the weather in Chicago.   If I ever come back to Chicago I have a reliable place to stay :)",1.0
Chicago,"Kay is an absolute pro of a host.  She communicated check-in instructions very clearly and regularly  touched-base to make sure I had everything I needed during my stay.  Her place is ideally situated a mere 5 minute walk from an L train station (which is a fantastic way to get around Chicago as I discovered).  Very comfortable, clean, and safe place to spend your nights when visiting Chicago-- can't recommend enough.",1.0
Chicago,"The misfortune of staying at Kay's is that one will quickly realize that not every host will be like her! :-/ I was able to take the train (as she pre-stay suggested) directly out of midway and walk about 2 blocks & if cleanliness is next to godliness, then trust Kay has you covered. And to be completely honest, Kay extended herself to me in an act that goes way beyond the scope of AirBnb. I was comfortable, I felt safe, the room was very dedicated. Being that she was my 1st AirBnb experience,  I really feel like I lucked up. Omg, and her snack bar (fresh yummies), were too delish! :-* #BookHer",1.0

We ended up spending a lazy Sunday lounging inside by the fireplace and watching dumb movies - an ideal way to spend a day after heavy touristing Friday and Saturday. She was incredibly accommodating throughout our stay with complications our party had with check in and check out. The surrounding area had an incredible pizza place, a bar where we got boozy ice cream floats, some breweries, and way more that we didn't have time to discover because we didn't want to leave the fire. Will 100% look to stay here again in the future!",1.0
Chicago,Excellent accommodation in quiet location (with easy access to the city centre). Very well presented apartment - the host has clearly gone to a lot of effort with the stylish detail. The underfloor heating is amazing and plenty of throws for the evening - flawless.,1.0

Chicago,"We stayed here for a week for a winter city break. And what a cozy place it was with the fire place and nice decor. Everything we needed was there, dish washer, washing machine with dryer, fast internet, nice big screen TV. I especially enjoyed all the books in the apartment!  Checking in was effortless with good instructions. Location is good, easy access from the airport and to the city with the CTA blue line. Logan Square neighborhood, while still a bit rough around the edges, is very interesting. Lots of good eateries, galleries and shops. You have to check out Lula Cafe.",1.0
Chicago,"Stayed a wintery week in Danielle's cozy space. The apartment was exactly as published and proved to be a nice base for exploring Chicago. The train was an easy walk and Logan Square is a cool and friendly neighborhood. From day one, Danielle proved to be a good communicator and a welcoming host. I would definitely consider staying with her again.",1.0

Chicago,This was a truly desperate search for a safe place for my daughter to stay last minute while out of town.  She made last minute plans to travel to Chicago for the Gold Cup soccer match.  Once there she could not find a hotel to rent to her because she is 18.  She was in her car crying.  I booked with Jim on the internet and spoke with him by phone.  He was so great!!!  He met her and her boyfriend at the door.  He even spoke Spanish with her boyfriend which made him feel great.  He assured me by phone about how safe the neighborhood  was and that he would be on the premises just a moments notice away.  He treated them like adults but still helped me feel comfortable about their safety knowing they will always be my babies.  It was truly above and beyond.  And my daughter said the apartment was gorgeous.,1.0

Chicago,Our stay was perfect! Everything was incredibly clean and smelled lovely when we walked in. They responded promptly to any messages I sent. The modern touch to the retro atmosphere made the apartment feel both cozy and familiar. We weren't bothered by any noise in the neighborhood neither during the day nor through the night.

Chicago,"This place is lovely. It’s a very clean and well restored apartment.  The windows are about at ground level, so actually the floor of the apartment is 2-3’ below ground level.  We liked this, it felt cozy and being on the ground floor was very convenient. The design of the kitchen and living room is very nice, the bedrooms are comfortable and private. Took a few baths, nice bathroom. It was very quiet, almost no street noise. Just a few blocks from Clark street and a few more to the train. We loved staying here!",1.0

Chicago,This apartment is a very stylish and super comfortable place.  It is on a quiet street on the edge of the popular Andersonville neighborhood.  There are plenty of restaurants and bars which you can easily walk to along with some boutique shopping.   You are a quick walk to several CTA bus routes and a longer walk to the red line.   Maximo was there when I checked in and I had a couple of questions during my week stay and they very promptly answered.   I would definitely recommend and stay in this location again.,1.0

Chicago,"Jim & Maximo’s apartment is beautiful & well located. This was our 3rd visit to Chicago for a girls weekend; first time in Andersonville. Nice quiet neighborhood with Uber/lyft convenience to most city locations in 15-20 min. Apartment is on ground floor, some street noise but overall very quiet. Neighborhood is safe with quick walks to great eating spots. We recommend the little red wolf & mhenry.  Apartment is well furnished with nice appliances & conveniences, great WiFi. Host was attentive, but only needed on day 1: we’re pretty low key. Only recommendation would be additional blankets/ linens for pull out couch in living area.",1.0
Chicago,"From the moment I booked, everything was five stars. I never waited on a reply. I was behind schedule on check in day, nevertheless, Maximo promptly greeted me and I checked in immediately. The place was spotless and it was better than advertised. The nieghborhood was quaint and there was always parking available.

Such an amazingly diverse, safe clean and welcoming neighborhood! the apartment was beautiful and absolutely spotless I've never seen anything so clean! Jim was amazing! I could not have asked for a better experience!",1.0
Chicago,"Our stay in Chicago was great and we really enjoyed staying in Andersonville. It was far enough away to be quiet but only a 12-15 minute walk to the train station, which we didn’t mind at all. The neighborhood felt safe enough to walk in and we liked the local coffee shops and restaurants.   The apartment was nicely decorated and clean. I would just give a heads up that if you’re a light sleeper you can hear the hosts upstairs because it’s an old building. I would never take away a star for this because it’s just a personal thing. My wife is a heavy sleeper and it never bothered her but I had to download a white noise app on my phone to fall asleep.   The hosts were great communicators and asked if we needed anything and how our stay was going. We both enjoyed it and would stay here again!",1.0
Chicago,"Jim's place is just as pictured and described and was a lovely, comfortable, clean and quiet place to stay while I visited family and friends in the Chicago area. The location is halfway between the main city and Evanston, which was perfect for me, and it was very close to some really cool restaurants/bakeries, etc. Had no trouble getting around and found parking on the street each night without trouble. Safe and quiet neighborhood. Jim and Maximo were very attentive and had supplied everything I needed for my stay. Would definitely stay there again.",1.0

Chicago,"Jim's place was FANTASTIC. The place was exactly what we expected it to be from the fabulous photos which were 100% accurate showing off the truly lovely and well decorated apartment. Very clean, well appointed, extra towels and pillows, fantastic magazines for relaxing reading, GREAT map of the local neighborhood in order to find fantastic local shops and places to eat.  You can totally get around on public transit (mostly CTA Bus) from this apartment. Note: the place is a little far from the CTA train stations into downtown. We rented a car and really appreciated the flexibility to get around the city easily and great neighborhood street parking.   The apartment is well appointed with everything you need for your stay. One of the bedrooms is street facing but there is not much traffic so it stayed very quiet at night. Air conditioning for the summer time is a huge plus on muggy hot days!  Andersonville neighborhood is one of my favorite areas of Chicago. It is quaint, full of local  charm, great eats and drinks within walking distance, and a fantastic way to get a feel of what real Chicago is like (and not the fake touristy stuff). Off the beaten path geek thing we did - we drove to and walked through the nearby Rosehill Cemetery Mausoleum. The old original section has a substantial collection of LC Tiffany stained glass windows and walking the completely silent hallways to see the sun shining through these beautiful windows is pretty awesome if you like that sort of thing.  Love Jim's place! Beyond 5 stars! We will hopefully be back to town and rent out his apartment again in the future. ",1.0
Chicago,"Great space to spend a few days. Neighborhood was a few miles north of the downtown area of Chicago. Very quiet but still had the Chicago city feel to it.

Chicago,"Jim and Maximo were great hosts! This spacious two-bed, one-bath is the perfect getaway for family and friends! I picked Andersonville, because it's a great LGBTQ+ friendly neighborhood and was a great location to experience all of the Pride festivities happening over the weekend during our stay.

It's very close to all the Andersonville shops and restaurants on Clark St. and a short walk to the el stop to go downtown; it's in a lovely, quiet, leafy neighborhood of brownstones. Parking was easy -- there was street parking right outside the apartment; we parked the car when we arrived Friday and didn't need to move it or use it until we left on Sunday. The apartment was very clean and well-appointed, with a great kitchen and nice amenities. Jim was there to give us the keys when we checked in; he and Maximo were available if needed but also gave us space. We'd highly recommend this one!",1.0

This is a great apartment with caring and involved hosts. I recommend staying here unconditionally!",1.0
Chicago,"The apartment was beautiful and very spacious. There are restaurants, grocery stores and pharmacies within walking distance. The neighborhood seemed very safe and we enjoyed walking around even in the cold weather. The Keurig and snack basket were nice touches which we appreciated. The beds were  too firm to be comfortable for me, but my boyfriend was fine with it, so it may be personal preference. Jim and Maximo were very attentive and always ready to help. Please note, the apartment does not have a microwave. Also, there is a policy that you cannot have any guest enter into the apartment (not just for sleeping, but for visiting too) which I misunderstood when booking, but it was not a problem since it was only the two of us. If you're traveling in a group or with family staying in other places, you may want to look for another place if you want them to be able to visit you. Overall our stay was lovely and we would recommend this apartment.",1.0
